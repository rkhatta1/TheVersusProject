Had a year to remember at Ajax, so the league had to make sure her flowers came right on time. This teen titan\u2019s just getting started and is already one of the biggest names in Europe. Lily\u2019s a record-breaker. The definition of a playmaker. One of the brightest talents to burst on the scene in recent history. Became the youngest player to start a UWCL match back in November. 11 G+A in 20 appearances for the Amsterdam side in 23/24. Moved so comfy on the pitch people had her confused for a club vet. Had a breakthrough so impressive, she skipped the youth international level and earned a spot in Emma Hayes\u2019 USWNT squad. Scored on her debut and put the world on notice. All before her 17th birthday. This is what a generational talent looks like. The only way is up from here, and Lily\u2019s stocks are going through the roof. Invest now before it\u2019s too late."}

People are giving it one star reviews but here\u2019s a spoiler: this will be absolute scenes. We ain\u2019t talking about the sausage roll when we say Nigerians love Gala. The trip from Ikeja to Istanbul is one for national heroes only. Emmanuel Emenike, Joseph Yobo, Ahmed Musa, and the legendary Jay-Jay Okocha to name a few. Now it\u2019s Vic O\u2019s turn to have an After Party following his celebration in Naples. Middle name is James and his stint as King has been going since he was 23. The Super Eagle that reigned supreme in Italy. Ended the drought and won Napoli their first title since the days of Maradona. Notched Serie A POTY. Became the first African to win the coveted Capocannoniere. Came, saw and conquered. 76 goals in 133 games. Dominance personified. Africa\u2019s Player of the Year. They\u2019ll say he fell off the pace last season but 15 goals in the league says otherwise. Now his latest assignment is to fend off a Fener team powered by Jos\u00e9. Naija boy vs Naija mentality. If you like sweet treats, this viewing will be a Turkish Delight. The Admin will be locked in."}

Spent a year abroad in Madrid, but this Matilda\u2019s back on the WSL\u2019s books. Odds are on Spurs causing headaches this season. This is a certified winner. A game-changer in every sense of the word. Decisive goals are her bread and butter. Whether it\u2019s an NWSL Championship or the world\u2019s biggest stage. This Aussie always delivers. Spent a few years in blue, but after a season with Las Blancas, she\u2019s decided Lilywhite is her colour. The North London club just topped off the transfer window with a bow. Pay close attention to N17 this season. This baller is more than just ribbons and sunshine. DRIP on her training kit so it\u2019s only right she\u2019s about to make it rain. HR\u2019s well-versed in hitman relations, and she\u2019s ready to raise hell in the WSL."}

Crashed home a hatty in Barca\u2019s 7-0 win over Real Valladolid. Make that 3G + 3A in his first four league games of the season. These are name brand numbers from a baller who\u2019s gone under the radar. This is what it looks like to make sure the masses remember your name. La Masia stays churning out wonderkids, but Raphinha\u2019s smooth with it like butter. Yamal is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s shiniest new toy, but real ones know Raphinha\u2019s story is creating a Buzz right now. Looked like his time at the Catalonian club might\u2019ve been running out, but now he\u2019s runnin\u2019 up them numbers. This is how you show your YG the ropes and get the work like a PT. EA Sports FC sponsors La Liga and Raphinha\u2019s treating it like UT with Unreal Tek. It makes sense that a manager called Flick is getting the most out of this jugador.

One of England\u2019s brightest young talents just traded her Chelsea Blues for green and white. After a close brush with glory last season, Lisbon\u2019s lions are on the hunt to end Benfica\u2019s era of dominance, and they tapped up the right Lioness to turn As \u00c1guias into prey. This young baller\u2019s next up for England\u2019s setup, already making her mark at youth level. Taking the big leap abroad at 18, RB\u2019s ready to assert her dominance, and she\u2019s about to put the world on notice. Sporting\u2019s been doing business quietly all summer, but Bose\u2019s signing just put their intentions on loudspeaker. With a squad full of youngstars, it\u2019s best not to sleep on what this team can do. With Ria in their ranks, the league\u2019s about to look real scary. Watch this space."}

You\u2019re looking at the fourth Madrid player in history to open his scoring account with two. And the withdrawal has Los Blancos fans laughing to the bank. Word to AJ, the first one was so nice, he had to do it twice. Heard all the chattings on his name and clapped back the only way a true No.9 knows how. Making the net ring like a Whatsapp call. This is how you step into the limelight and make things dark for your opps. To step into a team of world beaters and stand on business. Had Jude doing up \u2018VAMOS\u2019 from the stands. Anyone asking if KM9 has scored a free kick should know the best strikers don\u2019t need set pieces to move the streets. Forget what you heard. Kylian can\u2019t be stopped.

Make that four goals in his first three games of the season to lift PSG to the top of the table. You wanna talk about elevation? He\u2019s already matched his goal tally in Ligue 1 from last season in the first month of the new campaign. This ain\u2019t just greedy. It\u2019s an appetite for ascension. KM used to feast in the Uber Eats but this McDonald\u2019s sponsorship has transformed Barcola into PSG\u2019s ba-da-ba-ba-bagsman. Pulled up to Lille\u2019s gaff just to Drive Thru. Told their full-back \u201cjust put the fries in the bag, bro.\u201d Flew the flag for his country like K\u2019naan this summer. Now, the lion of Lyon is roaring loudly in the capital. Tourists come to see the light show at the Eiffel Tower. But if Bradley keeps these performances up, he\u2019ll become the main attraction. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien."}

They thought this team would fade away but they remain dishing out fades like A Star Barber. Had Erik ten Hag saying \u201cI ain\u2019t Harry Potter\u201d but Arne Slot\u2019s looking like a wizard. The first manager to achieve a perfect record in their first three Premier League games since the late Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson\u2019s Man City in 2007. Kloppball was Rock and Roll but Slotball has the opposition doing the stop, drop and roll. Pure fire. Luis D\u00edaz is channeling the spirit of savagery whilst rocking a bandage on his wrist. Mo Salah\u2019s dropping dimes like a jeweller. Ryan Gravenberch looking like Yaya Tour\u00e9 the way he\u2019s running up the field with grace. VVD is showing he\u2019s still VVS when it comes to defending. Nike Swoosh on their kit pointing up and their performances keep doing the same too. Put the word out. The Reds are rampant."}

The Admin\u2019s running out of bars to describe this bagsmania. Back to back hat-tricks? How GREEDY. 70 goals in 69 Premier League games. The first player to score seven in the first three games of the season. No other Premier League TEAM has more. Pro Clubs numbers from a striker who looks like he\u2019s playing on amateur mode. This is the definition of built different. Anyone tryna go machine for machine with EH9 will malfunction. This robot\u2019s chip ain\u2019t on his shoulder, it\u2019s in his brain. Haters say he isn\u2019t fun to watch. Real ones know brutal efficiency doesn\u2019t come with rainbow flicks. We are watching the best goalscorer to touch this league leave his fingerprints on all the scoring charts in real-time. Best believe he ain\u2019t gonna raw dog a 90 minute game with no G+A any time soon. All that time Pep played with a false nine. Word to Nas, now he Got Himself A Gun. If you ain\u2019t got Haaland in your FPL team, just double tap this and keep scrolling. The Erling Era is upon us. Learn to live with it."}

Pulled up to Goodison Park with bad intentions. This might just look like a player in form to the untrained eye. But look closer and you will see a player full of class. Real ones know this late comeback was Bournemouth heritage. But it was Antoine\u2019s goal that got the ball rolling. Summer\u2019s almost over but this baller right here is what fullbacks call a long day. Pace. Power. Panache. Can drift left or cut right. Can rass it from range and carry it into the box. Grabs games by the scruff of the neck so you know he\u2019s a handful. We ain\u2019t seen a Ghanaian bagsman in the PL this potent since Asamoah Gyan. But best believe this Black Star is going sky high. When it comes to forwards, Bournemouth know how to Cherry-pick them. Now Semenyo\u2019s the Cherry on top."}

Kennington where it started. King\u2019s Road where he\u2019s about to get it popping wholehearted. This one-time prince of European football is ready to get his crown back. Supported Chelsea as a boy and now he\u2019s due to pay that love back on the pitch. Sometimes when things don\u2019t go to plan, it\u2019s best to follow your heart. Best know this Harlem Spartan is about to scream 300 for the Shed End. You already know the truth. Jadon at his best moves like Bossman at Morley\u2019s the way he dishes out 3 piece combos. This ain\u2019t just about reviving the vibe, it\u2019s about restoring order. Never underestimate a baller with a point to prove. Has always deserved to play at the top level and Chelsea have given him the platform to Bridge that gap. Make sure you watch closely. A few games in you\u2019ll see True Blues screaming \u201cF what bro done, that\u2019s my jigga\u201d like Loski. Might\u2019ve spent some time in the wilderness.

Plays in DM but Does More than just shield the back line. Completed the most dribbles. Won the most tackles. Racked up 100% pass completion. They say the Championship is a league for seasoned vets but this 19-year-old is taking charge. Derby fans will be rubbing their hands together like Birdman because Ozoh is Cash Money. Wears the No.4 and plays with Vieira\u2019s vim. But you don\u2019t need any Vicks to smell what DO4 is about to cook this season. Some of the Prem\u2019s best ballers got first class honours in the second division. Now Ozoh is due to pass with flying colours. Class is in session."}

A certified hitman. Someone who can wake things up and put games to bed. Mbeumo just proved he\u2019s that guy for Brentford. Toney might\u2019ve dipped to Saudi, but Bryan\u2019s still saucin\u2019 on defenders in west London. This is what it looks like to step into the spotlight and when things get dark. We\u2019re witnessing a dangerous forward in action. Creates chances and finishes them. Can link-up with teammates and lock off games. Mbeumo and Wissa are TW8\u2019s Trecherous Twins. The Gtek\u2019s got a new genius. Bryan\u2019s got the Bees buzzin. Mbeumo hive stand up."}

The papers said he was frozen out of training. The streets will say he\u2019s heating up Selhurst Park. Whenever this baller has left home comforts, he\u2019s always delivered like an Uber Eats rider trying to get five stars. IYKYK. He mowed over green pastures when at Ipswich.

The best gift givers don\u2019t need a special occasion. The best present a No.9 can give is goals right now and that\u2019s exactly what Orban\u2019s on. Elite bagsmen don\u2019t always need the full 90 to hit the right angles. When it comes to rapping Chances, you don\u2019t want No Problem with Gift. This Cameo was so sweet, it had Lyon ultras doing the Candy dance. If you didn\u2019t know before, GO9 really does what it says on the tin. The garri Gerd Muller. The suya super-sub. Benue State\u2019s own Benzema. Whatever you call him, just call it correct. Orban\u2019s Gift is about to have Lyon living lavish. Make sure you\u2019re locked in to this breakout season."}

Just know Raz is gonna be screaming \u201cMad Out\u201d like Valiant. The last time he linked up with Mikel? 53 goal contributions. No agendas, just facts. They tried to rub the boy out but you can\u2019t erase history. The only current PL player with more G+A is Mo Salah. A member of the 100 PL goals club. Since 12/13, he\u2019s only failed to crack double figures once. Watch this king fling on the Jamaica jacket and act like he\u2019s at home in Kingston. About to make the Emirates his yard and let crocodile teeth fly like he\u2019s Skillibeng. Edu got the deal done overnight and said Thank yuh Jah fi wake me up this morning.

Realer ones know that if he gets a run of games, he\u2019ll show the world what he\u2019s truly about. Once a goalscorer, always a goalscorer. The way that phone is gonna ring off, you\u2019d have thought he opened a call centre. Arsenal are all guns blazing currently but Eddie\u2019s contribution to this moment should not be forgotten. During 21/22, he was part of the side that nearly rescued top four \u2013 including that brace against Chelsea. Next season he bagged goals when called upon, including a brace against United. Still remains the only player to clap a hat-trick for Arsenal since Aubameyang left the Emirates. Whilst this marks the end of one journey, it\u2019s also the start of a new one. They say there\u2019s no place like home and best believe Eddie is going to look comfy at his. Bank on this Black Star shooting off into a new orbit. Your defence is in trouble."}

The Admin might start calling this club Chelsea Italia with the amount of former blues on their books, but real ones know Tammy can make them the Pride of Milan once again. From smashing up loan spells to breaking the No.9 curse for his boyhood Chelsea. Performing like a true gladiator in his first season in Italy notching 27 goals to winning the Conference League with Jos\u00e9. This is a man who\u2019s manifested greatness time and time again.

One of United\u2019s own is leaving home to embark on an Italian adventure. Once Conte made the bird call, McTom had to leave the nest and take his career to the heights it deserves. But when United runs through your blood, none of your bangers go in vain. Let\u2019s not forget Scott\u2019s Greatest Hits. That two-piece he hit Leeds with in the 2nd and 3rd minute in 20/21. The 40-yard screamer against City to seal a 2-0 derby day dub. The two stoppage-time goals off the bench against Brentford to send OT to the moon like ET. When it comes to deciding games, Scotty 2 Hotty has ice in his veins. When it\u2019s time to lock in, McTom knows how to break games wide open. Haters called him a \u2018teacher\u2019s pet\u2019. But the only animal The Admin sees is dawg. And this Dalmatian is about to earn his spot in a top team. From a YG to a captain, McTom has done it all at United. But the next chapter is about to hit. Serie A is about to witness the coldest knee slider in the game. McSauce might have left Manneh but he\u2019s about to be mustard in Naples."}

This might be the first time you\u2019re hearing her name, but make no mistake, this wasn\u2019t pure luck. Ovalle\u2019s not your ordinary baller. Hails from Aguascalientes, so you know she puts defenders in boiling hot water every time she steps on the pitch. Look her up and you\u2019ll see banger after banger, golazo after golazo. Scored four goals in ten minutes just before the half to send Tigres roaring into the break. Midweek f\u00fatbol has never looked so good. Stars like this don\u2019t come around often, so it\u2019s only right to give this No.14 her tens right now. Barely in her prime and already racked up 226 caps for Las Amazonas. Over 100 goals to her name. Liga MX has a hidden gem in their ranks, and it\u2019s time for the world to wake up and smell the horchata. This jugadora\u2019s going straight to the top."}

Everyone raised their eyebrows when he made the move to La Liga in the summer. Now The Admin\u2019s raising a glass to his efforts. Call him the Buckfast Batistuta. The Canary Islands Cantona. The easyJet Eusebio. Went from looking like a polar bear in Arlington, Texas to a baller in his natural habitat. Turned up against the brightest talents in the world and never once flinched at the diamond tester. Haters had Las Palmas going down to the second division last season. But real ones know with McBurnie up top, anything\u2019s possible in 24/25. From cheffing up in the Steel City to cooking in the Canaries. The Irn Bru bagsman is officially outside."}

We ain\u2019t talking about the imminent game release when we say FC is gonna be the talk of the town. Some have tried to say he\u2019s finished, but this move to the Kop End is about to be a fresh new start. Don\u2019t get it twisted. This is still one of the most exciting forwards in Europe. Notched double figures in goals for the first time in two seasons post his cruciate ligament injury. Before that, everyone knew what time he was on. Those performances at the Euros had him putting defenders in a blender like he was trying to make a smoothie. If you saw those moments on the jumbotron, just know that you\u2019re gonna see much more of that on MOTD very soon. Might have rocked the Jeep sponsor on his Juve kit but he\u2019s about to look like a Ferrari in the red of Liverpool. A 1v1 demon with the grace of an angel. Parts defences like Moses did the Red Sea. Football fans always talk about investing stocks but Liverpool have played a masterclass in buying the dip.

Bossed the U23s for Uncle Titi, now it\u2019s time to be a main man for Grandpa Deschamps. It\u2019s crazy to think that a few seasons ago this baller was plying his trade in the Championship. Fast forward to today and he\u2019s on a superstar trajectory for Les Blues. Allez."}

One of the coldest debuts in recent times. Pure jugador-ing. Subbed into the game at half-time and said \u201cthe game is mine\u201d like C Biz. Changed the whole flow of events. He literally popped out and showed brothers. Smashed the crossbar from distance, notched the match winner and secured Man of the Match. All in an evening\u2019s work. This wasn\u2019t just about bagging the winner though, this was restoring the feeling. Had the Culers screaming \u201cthis is what a Barcelona player looks like.\u201d You know he was on mission when you saw him hit the Dame Lillard celebration. Real ones know Dame Time means \u201cnight night\u201d so it\u2019s only right Olmo put Rayo Vallecano to bed. He left La Masia as a boy, but he\u2019s returned to this team to be the man. Tap in."}

The Atlas Lions have one of the coldest cubs in the game right now. Only 19 but his mind is old. You know he\u2019s a Prodigy who has his opps looking like Shook Ones. Bagged two goals in four minutes against the Central African Republic because sometimes you don\u2019t have to long it out. Just get straight to the kitchen and start cooking with the big spoon. Add that to the 1G + 2A in his last three games for Monaco and it\u2019s clear this baller is breaking out for the top spot. But this ain\u2019t just about his numbers. Ben Seghir passes the eye test with flying colours. This is a YG who Yearns for Greatness with every touch. North Africa is known for producing tekky players and EBS is no different. Bringing that cage football vim to the international stage. An FC Rush player IRL who rushes his opps in more ways than one. Left foot or right foot. Dribble and shoot or first-time finish. The outcome will always be the same. Cash money. Big Ben is one to watch. His time is now."}
{"prompt": "A young player made his international debut for Malta as a substitute against Moldova, winning a penalty that secured a late victory for his team.", "completion": "Basil Tuma is living his movie. Sometimes the brightest players have to light their own path, and this young baller is no different. 19 years old, graduated from Eton College and is now a student of the game. Came off the bench to make his international debut for Malta and won the penalty to secure the dub against Moldova. This ain\u2019t your regular breakout story. This is the stuff of parental paradise. Basil\u2019s building a career no one can Brush off. Anyone who missed out on Project Mbapp\u00e9 might want to start Operation Tuma. Might play for Reading, but Tuma\u2019s already done enough to rewrite the script. Most people have to choose between the boots or the books, but Tuma is here to show you can choose both. Born in Uganda, raised in the UK and already showing he doesn\u2019t falter for Malta. The start has been fun, but the best is yet to come."}
{"prompt": "Sebastian Nanasi scored two goals for the Swedish national team in an international match against Estonia.", "completion": "Sebastian Nanasi is one silky Swede. Bagged his first brace for the national team against Estonia to carry on a stellar season. 3G + 2A in six Ligue 1 games for Strasbourg. Add that to the 3G + 1A he clapped for Malm\u00f6 in four UCL qualifying games before touching down in France. We have a serious goal-getter on our hands. But anyone who\u2019s peeped him on the pitch knows his profile is peak. A MF with More Flavour than most. Drifts into pockets and knows how to leave with somethin\u2019 like a thief in the night. They say \u201cfirst impressions are everything\u201d and Nanasi is ballin\u2019 with that firm handshake grip. Forget making yourself part of the furniture, SN15 is building his name from scratch like he copped it from IKEA. Flat packing and stat padding. This baller\u2019s making Chelsea fans develop a taste for Swedish meatballs even though there\u2019s rice at home. One thing\u2019s for certain though, Nanasi is making sure everyone\u2019s fed."}

{"prompt": "Elisabeth Terland scored two goals for Manchester United against Tottenham Hotspur, with Celin Bizet assisting both goals, one a volley and the other a header, marking Terland's debut goals for the club.", "completion": "Elisabeth Terland and Celin Bizet are restoring the feeling. Dynamic duos are back in full effect. We could talk about Elisabeth starting her royal reign of Manchester United with a bang. But we would be doing an injustice without mentioning the jewel in her crown: CB. Two goals against Spurs saw Terland get off the mark for the Red Devils. With her Norwegian counterpart providing heavenly crosses for both moments, too. Nothing but \u2018to me, to you\u2019 hours. For every whip from Bizet, Terland made sure she had some dip. You haven\u2019t seen a cash money combo like this for United since Ashley Young used to feed Fellaini for fun. Real football heritage before your eyes. A pinpoint cross for a volley followed by a targeted delivery for a header. ET19 and CB15 are future cult heroes. Not talking about the film when we say ET is extra-terrestrial. She ain\u2019t no rapper but C.Biz is making the game hers right now. If their performances are anything to go by, these two will turn Leigh Sports Village into Valhalla. United have two queens in their ranks with the power of Vikings. Time to go forth and dominate."}

This baller bagged two goals to secure three points for Manchester City. Cometh the hour, cometh the conquerer. Call her Koffee the way blessings fall by her right foot. Had the opposition on Toast all afternoon before sending an absolute rocket in additional time to secure the dub. You haven\u2019t seen a strike like this since FIFA Street gave us game breakers. Had Gareth Thomas saying \u201cgratitude is a must\u201d when the ball touched the back of the net. Make that three goals in her first four games this season. We ain\u2019t talking about the Norwegian striker when we say Manchester City have a generational forward in their ranks. And we ain\u2019t talking about Titi when we say beware when you see this baller pull on the black gloves. Bunny Shaw stays hopping over expectations. Last season\u2019s Golden Boot winner keeps setting the golden standard for all. Pay your respects."}

Tore her ACL back in 2022 and the world has been itching for her comeback season ever since. Two years and four surgeries later, she just made her 100th NWSL appearance and sealed the deal with a goal. The celebration said it all. This was more than just a stoppage time golazo. The league just witnessed the return of a national treasure. An NWSL icon and a living USWNT legend. Had her first season in Los Angeles cut short by injury, but this angel just got her wings back. In the words of Tobin Heath, this was a vintage CP23 performance. A quick dribble into the box and a shot that had ears ringing across the country. The type of goal that had people giving her a standing ovation in their living rooms. NWSL news hot off the press: Angel City\u2019s biggest hooper is back to giving defenders hell on the pitch. Let the remontada begin."}

Again. Just became the first person in NWSL history to score 19 goals in one season with two matches left to outdo herself. Walked out in the minty fresh kit, so you know she was moving cleaner than Listerine on the pitch. Nothing but smiles for this icon tonight. If you\u2019re not already familiar with TC\u2019s game, here\u2019s a two-word summary: Too. Cold. This is the definition of an all-around baller. A No. 9 by nature that can kickstart an attack like a 10 and defend like a world-class CB. Signed with Kansas City in January and had already pulled The Current out of the trenches by June. Became the first player in the league to score in eight consecutive matches. The first player to score in 15 different matches in a single season. And those are just records from this year. Racked up 63 goals to her name in 2023 alone to become the year\u2019s leading goalscorer \u2013 the first African woman to do so. A Scorcher from birth, and she\u2019s not done burning up the competition yet. Balling out in the same city as Mahomes, but there\u2019s a new MVP in town and she\u2019s just getting started."}
{"prompt": "Luka Modri\u0107 delivered an exceptionally dominant and influential midfield performance for Croatia against Scotland, showcasing his enduring quality and all-around abilities at 39 years old.", "completion": "Luka Modri\u0107 is alien. This baller right here is sonning Father Time. Call him E.T. the way he\u2019s hooping in the extra time of his career. 39 years and still answering his nation\u2019s call as the best player on the pitch. Took Scotland to school as one of the game\u2019s longest serving teachers. Who needs goal involvements when you\u2019re involved in everything else? 11 passes into the final third. Eight duels won. Six interceptions. Three tackles. Four take-ons. Three chances created. One vintage performance to remind the streets only the best can ball at this age. Close enough to 40 that you\u2019d think he\u2019s Drake. But to anyone who doubted his level, If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late. What\u2019s a Tartan Army to a midfield general? This vet is a whole different animal. Put up the type of performance that\u2019ll convince oldheads they still might have it. Turning back the clocks and still spinning his opps out their socks. 181 caps is no joke. Of all the international games Croatia have played since their independence, Modri\u0107 has played more than half. This is the purest example that class never dies. It just matures. Luka, The Admin salutes you."}
{"prompt": "Mayra Ram\u00edrez scored the opening goal and delivered a highly dominant individual performance for Chelsea against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, consistently troubling the home team's defense.", "completion": "Mayra Ram\u00edrez just made Arsenal\u2019s gun jam. Bagged the opener with a clever hooked finish and showed she could bob and weave too. Pulled up to the Emirates and took flight each time she touched the ball. Clear the runway settings. Whoever said \u2018there\u2019s no smoke without fire\u2019 could only have been talking about MR7. Ice cold and still burning her opps. This baller is the complete package who always knows how to deliver. Pace. Poise. Precision. And she\u2019s been pushin\u2019 P all season. That\u2019s now 2G + 2A in four games for Chelsea this season. But this game was the perfect example of how you stress out an entire defence on your ones. Real \u2018run up, get done up\u2019 hours. Anyone trying to knock her off the ball got their bell rung. Running through the channels like she was trying to find something to watch and put on a show of her own. Makes sense that the tekkiest player on the pitch barked off her Technical+ playstyle. The Colombian striker fried the Gunners\u2019 back line like an empanada and had Chelsea fans shouting \u2018wepa!\u2019. If you didn\u2019t know before, now you do. Ram\u00edrez ain\u2019t to be ramped with."}

Never heard of the kid before but guess what? The Admin is about to school you. This freshman just embarrassed a bunch of seniors. Bolivia beat Colombia 1-0 and the moment arrived thanks to a wonder-strike from this wonderkid. Cut inside, feinted and finished with his left like a prime Robben. Less talk about the opposition not being able to deal with the altitude, and how about we start dealing with this baller\u2019s attitude? This golazo was the definition of mean and green. La Verde have now won three competitive games for the first time in 27 years, and it\u2019s no shock o Miguelito has played his part in all of those wins. Make that three goals in three games against Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. Not even 21 yet but he\u2019s moving like a real Savage on the international stage. The maddest part is that he still plays most of his football for Santos\u2019 U20s. Load up your FM saves and sign him. Contact your local comp maker and submit a request. This won\u2019t be the last time you hear about this guy. The sky is the limit."}

Just picked up Liverpool\u2019s POTM award after three matches in her debut WSL season. Three starts, one golazo, all the hype. Made headlines when she became the Reds\u2019 most expensive signing over the summer, and she\u2019s not stopped living up to the title. Threw her into the pressure cooker, but this diamond just keeps getting brighter. Hails from the 6ix, but she\u2019s moving like K.Dot. There ain\u2019t nobody in the WSL like her. This baller\u2019s given the league just a glimpse of what she can do, and she\u2019s putting the opps on red alert. Creates chances the second she steps on the pitch. A game-changer and an unstoppable force. And she\u2019s only 20. Still a kid, but Liv\u2019s showing early signs of GOAT syndrome. Liverpool\u2019s got a big, big baller on their hands and she\u2019s ready to show out. Keep one eye open when Olivia\u2019s in town. This isn\u2019t one to be messed with."}

It was a perfect tribute to their teammate George Baldock who sadly passed away earlier this week at the age of 31. The former Sheffield United full-back represented Greece on 12 occasions following his first call-up to the national side in 2022. After Vangelis Pavlidis scored his country\u2019s first-ever goal at Wembley last night, the whole team paid tribute to George by raising his shirt and pointing to their black armbands. The team\u2019s performance epitomised Baldock as a player. Determination and giving your all for 90 minutes, even if you\u2019re the underdog. His passing serves as a timely reminder that every moment is precious. Whilst we all love the game, this is an example of how beautiful it can be. Sending strength and power to this team and everyone connected to George."}

First time Harder\u2019s touched a UWCL scoresheet in almost two years but still left her fingerprints all over this game. A perfect hat-trick for a perfect performance. That\u2019s now 38 goals in 50 Champions League games for four different clubs. A true bagswoman everywhere she goes. Her body of work is head and shoulders above the field, so it makes sense how she can keep rising it at the top level. Used to play for Chelsea but her goals still come like London buses. When it comes to attacking balls in the box, no-one is out-dawgin\u2019 this great Dane. This baller has the hardest name in the game with the tek to match. Pernille is Harder than the rest."}

You won\u2019t find many other examples of siblings doing it big on bigger stages than these two. We\u2019re talking about a duo who were African champions together. A duo who have lifted the Premier League on the same team and on their own. Their ascendancy from Abidjan would see them become African giants. Both got their start at ASEC Mimosas, an Ivorian club based in their hometown. Kolo would soon go on to join Arsenal in 2002, and in August of that year faced up in a pre-season friendly against his younger brother Yaya, who had joined Belgian side Beveren. The rest was history. Unapologetically themselves, both brothers would go on to achieve greatness in the game.

Flight mode activated. Silenced the doubters with some clinical precision in front of goal. Finessed her first shot before cooly converting a pen for her second. AB has always made it easy to C why she\u2019s a top baller. 11 goals in the Championship was her warm up. Three games into the top flight and she\u2019s already notched two.

We haven\u2019t seen a hitman move this scary since The Wire. Might not be pulling up in a trenchcoat but defenders are feeling it when they see Omar coming. His stoppage time equaliser against Bayern Munich is what made the headlines. But you need to deep the full story. You\u2019re looking at the top scorer in the Bundesliga this season. A brace and assist in a 3-3 against Vincent Kompany\u2019s men makes it twelve goal contributions in total. Eight goals. Four assists. In only six matches. Potent. Frankfurt are nicknamed the Eagles, and this baller is moving like an apex predator. Word to Randy Orton. He\u2019s dishing out RKOs left, right and centre. Joined on a free but this superstar is showing that he\u2019s Money In The Bank. Invest your stocks before it\u2019s too late."}

When you\u2019ve got as much class as Keira, you can\u2019t be put in a box. Adding another string to her bow and hitting the target with ease. Popping up in the final third like the final boss. Her assist for Pajor had so much disguise the Madrid defenders were wondering if Halloween came early. Add that to two finishes that are gonna start some serious conversations about KW21\u2019s standing in the game. We know she can pick a pass. But now she\u2019s picking corners for fun too? It\u2019s about to get long. Just in time for her former club Manchester City in the Champions League midweek. Rochdale\u2019s Regista or Bar\u00e7a\u2019s box-crasher.

Lines up alongside Jesus and Gabriel but BS7 is the one handing out blessings. More assists than any other player in Europe\u2019s top five leagues so far this season. Seventh heaven like the number on his back. Three points closer to the holy grail."}

She was only on the pitch for 13 minutes but best believe this was her lucky day. Five touches. One shot. One goal. Maximum efficiency. Came through Arsenal\u2019s academy, so it makes sense why she\u2019s such a comfy shooter. Might be on loan but this Gunner still doesn\u2019t miss. The talent is already VVS. And Agyemang\u2019s future is brighter than ever. Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you."}
{"prompt": "Jesurun Rak-Sakyi scored two goals for his team, nicknamed 'the Blades', against Luton in a Championship match on his 22nd birthday, delivering a dominant individual performance.", "completion": "Jesurun Rak-Sakyi is a cut above the rest for the Blades. This baller\u2019s really cheffing it up in Sheffield. Bagged a brace on his birthday and celebrated in more ways than one. Turned 22 and served Luton two slices of cake with no napkin. How impolite. Anyone who was sleeping on this talent just got a rude awakening. Four dribbles completed. Two chances created. Nine duels won. And a performance to show Palace fans they\u2019ve got a Crystal clear talent on their books. This one had The Admin doing the Pardew skank. Get you a winger who can cut inside and out with the same vim. It gets sticky both ways like some double sided tape. We are witnessing the rise of one of the most electrifying young ballers this country has to offer. Chopped 15G + 8A for Charlton last season. Now he\u2019s cheffing man up in the Championship. Invest your stocks while you still can."}
{"prompt": "Nikita Parris, in her first Women's Super League start for Brighton, scored an equalizing goal and provided an assist for the winning goal against Aston Villa.", "completion": "Nikita Parris is Brighton\u2019s newest spark. Bagged a G+A on her first WSL start for the Seagulls to let everyone know she\u2019s off to a flyer. Only needed a minute to tie the game up with her goal. Then set up Pauline Bremer to leave Villa fans\u2019 stomachs in knots. Known for her speed, but this baller hit the ground running and hit Aston Villa with the \u201cmeep meep\u201d. Critics raised their eyebrows when she joined from Man United in the summer. Now they\u2019re raising a glass to Parris like they\u2019re on a romantic retreat. But this is the kind of instant impact you have to love. Who needs a bedding in period when you been putting defenders to sleep for 10+ years? Brighton\u2019s attacking options run deep, but Nikita\u2019s bag is deeper. Popping up all over the pitch and getting it crackin\u2019 like a chiropractor to make sure there was no way back for the Villans. If you didn\u2019t know, now you do. Parris is still peak."}
{"prompt": "A player's sustained strong form and adaptation to a new deeper midfield role, highlighted by a dominant individual performance in a recent match against Crystal Palace.", "completion": "Ryan Gravenberch has been reborn. The Admin\u2019s seen all the comments and is here to pay homage to Liverpool\u2019s latest lynchpin. This is how you go from underrated to appreciated. Slot into a deeper midfield role that Arne carved out for him and started cutting shapes ever since. This is the kind of transformation Optimus was doing in his Prime. From squaddie to stylin\u2019 on every pitch he\u2019s touched this season. RG is Regulating Guys. Drops a shoulder like prime Russ Millions and knows how to use his Body-ody to protect the ball. Half-turns on full violence. Real \u201cnothing\u2019s over there\u201d hours. This MF is a Rolls Royce who Ghosts pasts his opps for fun. So press-resistant that the media ain\u2019t even caught on yet. Gravenberch got his markers grabbin\u2019 shirts. South London might be known as the Concrete Catalonia but Ryan bopped through and showed Palace what Dutch Delicacy looks like. This is ain\u2019t the first masterclass and it won\u2019t be the last. Put the word out. Gravenberch is gliding."}

We ain\u2019t talking about the UFC fighter when we say this guy is the Nigerian Nightmare. Left Manchester United looking like Boychester Divided the way he split them apart. The Red Devils needed heavenly intervention in order to avoid defeat following this bagsman\u2019s brace. A masterclass in popping up and showing brothers. Five shots. Five duels won. Three shots on target. Two goals. Boss moves. Make that seven goals in his last six games for Porto. The 20-year-old is moving mythical for the Dragons. Went up against De Light and had him seeing the dark. Real ones know that Nigerians no day carry last but this guy was first to every single ball. Pounded his finishes into the net like he was trying to make the softest yam to box off with some efo. Left United in serious stew like they were assorted meat. Formerly of Atl\u00e9ti, now representing for Porto. The striker bloodline of both clubs alone means he was only ever rising to the top.

If you weren\u2019t familiar with this baller\u2019s game, it\u2019s time to get clued up. The 19-year-old dropped a first class performance on the European stage last night. Four goals were scored and he was involved in three. Scored two, assisted one and there needs to be zero questions on his name. Came up against Rangers and showed he had the Power. Lacazette and Cherki might receive all the plaudits at Lyon but Fofana said it\u2019s morphing time and levelled up. Make that three goals in his last two matches including a last-minute match winner against Toulouse. You wanna talk about ballin\u2019 outta of control? This guy moved so crazy, the Belgian national team had no other option but to call him up after last night. This Red Devil sent his Scottish opps to hell but The Admin only wants to see more of these flames. This kid is going straight to the top."}

Announced his retirement in August. Now he\u2019s just signed a one-year deal with Barcelona. This Pole is about to have one last dance. Cashed in his Money In The Bank briefcase like prime Edge and told everyone \u201cYou Think You Know Me.\u201d This one right here was a whole different kind of Woj Bomb. Told his family \u201cI love the game, I love the hustle\u201d like Money Making Mitch, so best believe he\u2019s due to get Paid In Full. Had his drivers pull up to Barcelona\u2019s training ground like they just completed a heist, so you know this move is a steal. Lewandowski made the bird call and Szcz\u0119sny took flight. Two Poles at opposite ends of the pitch but this one still feels like a perfect match. Streets are saying he was about to bust open a pack of Marlboro but jumped on the first thing smoking instead. GKs are used to saving the day, but Szcz\u0119sny is about to make a superhero sweep between the sticks. Put your lighters up."}

Fired home four goals in 38 minutes for Stoke against Portsmouth. Upped the pumpy on Pompey to give the streets a masterclass in finishing. Bagged two with either foot. One free-kick. One pen. And a performance to show he\u2019s one of a kind. The best bagsmen need a range of finishes in their arsenal and this ST has the firepower to make it hot for anyone. Cannon by name and rassin\u2019 shots is his game. Ballin\u2019 so hard for the Potters he has fans thinking he\u2019s a wizard. Even Payps watched and clocked Real Is Back In Style. The Championship is where champions are made and we\u2019re witnessing a medalist in the making. Might be on loan from Leicester but this baller\u2019s already got Fox in the box tendencies. TC9 is on volts. Don\u2019t act shocked when he brings his tek to the top level."}

You\u2019re looking at the LFA Premier League Player of the Year. They said the Devil Wears Prada so it makes sense this midfield demon was Pushing P on the red carpet last night. Odumodublvck once told us to \u201cDo like Declan Rice\u201d and Mikel Arteta took his advice. Arsenal went through heartbreak last year but this DR has got them on the mend. Ever-present and ever-dependable. Not everyone needs a captain\u2019s armband to be a real leader. Anyone who tried to question the M\u00fcller spent on his signature is now sitting in a Corner real quiet. Rice is the truth and the proof is in the pudding. Providing defensive assurance while also coming up clutch when it matters most. Get you a man who can do both. Heavy is the head that wears the crown but Declan\u2019s showing he can shoulder the pressure. You\u2019re looking at a real King of London.

A mutation, if you will.\n\nThe home and third kits feature a graphic of Leonardo\u2019s face in white and black, replacing the Paramount+ logo that usually graces the front of Inter\u2019s shirts.

Don\u2019t let the scoreline fool you. This was an epic clash of European giants. Think Don Quixote vs The Count of Monte Cristo. Rosal\u00eda vs Aya Nakamura. In the end, Les Bleues were no match for La Roja. As always, Blaugrana ballers were front and centre in another Spanish victory. Herencia del f\u00fatbol. Aitana Bonmat\u00ed put the Spaniards in front 30 minutes in. Mariona Caldentey put the match to bed 20 minutes later. Light work. The world champions lifted their second trophy in less than a year, and only their second major title in history. This side\u2019s stock just keeps going up. If you aren\u2019t already invested, better open up that Robinhood app. La Roja on target has the whole world seeing red. They say heavy is the head that wears the crown, but these crimson queens make it look easy. Spain is sitting comfy at the top, and nobody\u2019s been able to dethrone them yet.

Bagged a brace against Southampton to secure Liverpool\u2019s route to the FA Cup QFs. Knockout artist. Make that three games, two goals and one trophy in 7 Days.

Not many knew this hitman\u2019s name when he sent Chelsea spinning on Sunday, but there\u2019s no denying his claim on the game right now. JD\u2019s sport has got the streets locked.

Hopped out of retirement to score four goals and send the Matildas to the Olympics, and prove she\u2019s still got it. Her first start for Australia in 2,183 days. Don\u2019t call it a comeback. Took the field at the Marvel Stadium so you know Michelle had to turn into Hawkeye in front of goal. Walked into that Tillies\u2019 dressing room like she had all six infinity stones and made sure it was Endgame in the first half. 11 minutes. That\u2019s how long it took for this sniper to score a hat-trick. Might as well change her surname from Heyman to Hitman the way she never misses. Scored her fourth just before half-time and let her teammates finish the job. Might be a Matilda but she was moving like Trunchbull last night. Who\u2019s she gonna put in the chokey next?"}

Bradley, Clark, McConnell, Danns and Quansah unlocked instant cult hero status but it was a certified legend who led them through the fire. One time for Virgil van Dijk.

The away team are supposed to be guests, but this 2-1 win has them looking like Hollowman. Real Landlord Hours. Silva\u2019s side\u2019s away form has been looking like copper all season but finally, a gold-standard performance has landed. It only needed two Super Eagles to take flight. Bassey with the first and Iwobi with the second. First name Calvin but let\u2019s keep it brief like his phone call to his mum. This finish was bonkers. And we ain\u2019t talking about tech when we say AI is taking over the timeline right now. The first Fulham player to score a winning goal at OT since Steed Malbranque in 2003.

His father, grandfather and great uncle have already pulled on the famous white shirt, so it only makes sense the Elland Road Reigns is following his Bloodline.

Some tried to say that UCL nights make them feel sleepy but this baller just screamed \u201cwake the fxck up!\u201d like an Eddie Abbew rant. Porto 1-0 Arsenal. Read that again. Say it loudly so it settles in. Arsenal may have tried to Enter the Dragon like a Bruce Lee film but they just got showed that the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o has More Fire than that grime collective from East London.

Manchester United have a recent legacy of looking to elders to lead the line but enough of the washed kings, it\u2019s time for the humble prince. Made the Hatters turn into real haters after notching his quick brace. Was balling out with goals in five consecutive league games but decided to hit them with \u201csix\u201d like a tag on a Drake record. The youngest player in Premier League history to complete the feat. They tried to say Rasmus went 007 twice but real ones know he was neither shaken nor stirred. Now he\u2019s popping out of place like he\u2019s double jointed. Started off by rounding the goalkeeper and doubled his tally by doing the Inzaghi finish. RH by initials but just know that stands for a Real Heritage finisher. It was off with Luton\u2019s heads as the ball diverted in off his chest. Rasmus by name but Erasmus in movement the way he\u2019s schooling defenders home and away. Harry Styles may have been watching on from above but real ones know that this baller\u2019s stocks are heading in One Direction, and that\u2019s up."}
{"prompt": "Simon Adingra, having recently won the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, scored two goals for Brighton & Hove Albion in a subsequent Premier League match against Sheffield United.", "completion": "Simon Adringra is unstoppable. Wrapped up AFCON for the Elephants last Sunday. Trampled all over Sheffield United with a brace for the Seagulls yesterday. This is what you call taking your game to new heights. Make that four G+A in his last two games from club and country, but the stats only tell half the story. Started his career at the Right to Dream Academy in Ghana so you better WAKE THE F*CK UP to his talents. 11 goals and nine assists in 30 games on loan at Union Saint-Gilloise was enough for the Seagulls to make the bird call. Now he\u2019s reintroducing himself like Hov down in Hove. Heard RDZ was in need of an MVP against the Blades and Simon said \u201cI\u2019m a cut above the rest\u201d. Pascal might have hit a pinpoint cross for his first effort, but overlooking the finish would be Gro\u00df misconduct. Don\u2019t let his second goal deflect away from his performance, either. Real \u201cshooters always shoot\u201d hours. Makes sense you can\u2019t spell Adingra without a \u201cring\u201d. The type of dedication that can only come from being married to The Beautiful Game. You\u2019re looking at a son of the soil that is answering the call. Simon says pay attention."}
{"prompt": "Mohamed Salah delivered a Player of the Match performance in an away match against Brentford, scoring one goal and providing one assist.", "completion": "Mo Salah hasn\u2019t skipped a beat. Rocked up to the Gtech and G checked the rest of the league to let them know the Big Dog is back. Goal? Check. Assist? Check. POTM award? Haters should know better. Make that 25 goal contributions this season to prove when it comes to the Barclays, you don\u2019t get more cash money than Mo. Provided Mac10 with the ammo to grab the second before turning into a shooter himself for the third. There\u2019s no \u201cI\u201d in \u201cteam\u201d so we have to hail up the way he had Mee moving mad for that finish. Klopp\u2019s soldiers are falling by the minute but his Egyptian King is back with perfect timing. It\u2019s time to watch the throne."}
{"prompt": "Arsenal secured a commanding 3-1 victory over Manchester United in a Women's Super League match, establishing a dominant 3-0 lead by halftime. The game, played at the Emirates Stadium, set a new WSL attendance record with 60,160 fans, and the win significantly boosted Arsenal's title aspirations.", "completion": "Arsenal 3-1 Man United. The Gunners just made history on a day the Red Devils will want to forget. Sold out the Emirates to set an all-time WSL record of 60,160 and delivered a performance the hottest ticket in town deserved. Taylor might be selling out North London back-to-back later this summer, but AFC just made Swift work of their opps to prove they deserve to make music on the biggest stage. This one was wrapped inside 40 like a vintage Drake beat. Geyse\u2019s O.G. got the party started before Lacasse said it\u2019s time to Take Care of business with the second. Kim Little loomed large to bag the third before HT and leave United fans screaming \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d like the Simpsons GIF. One and two might have grabbed the spotlight last night, but the third horse in this race just showed us the title charge isn\u2019t already dead. Mount up."}
{"prompt": "AIK Football Club commemorated the centenary of Sweden's top-flight league, Allsvenskan, by unveiling a limited-edition heritage kit, with proceeds dedicated to charity.", "completion": "As one of the original clubs of Allsvenskan, Nike and AIK are celebrating a century of Sweden\u2019s top-flight with a limited-edition cup jersey.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWith more seasons in the division than any other club, AIK and Allsvenskan\u2019s histories are intricately linked to each other, so for this special kit, the Swedish giants went all the way to the very beginning. Inspired by the club\u2019s first Allsvenskan kit from 1924, the shirt is black with yellow cuffs and a classic V-neck collar.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThe yellow shirt numbers and the \u2018AIK\u2019 on the chest arrive in soft velvet, nodding to the hand sewn letters on the original jersey from 100 years ago. To properly replicate the original kit, AIK will wear longsleeves for the first time in their partnership with Nike.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThe first 133 kits will be available to purchase via a raffle \u2013 open to AIK season ticket holders \u2013 from February 17-23.

{"prompt": "A pivotal 1-0 away victory for Manchester City over Chelsea in the Women's Super League, ending Chelsea's extensive home unbeaten run in the league and moving City level on points at the top of the table. The decisive goal was scored by Bunny Shaw, with goalkeeper Khiara Keating making critical injury-time saves to secure the win and clean sheet.", "completion": "Manchester City just pulled off a madness. This 1-0 over Chelsea is more than just a dub, it\u2019s a statement of intent. City hadn\u2019t won here since 2016 but they flipped the script to give CFC their first home defeat in the WSL since 2021. Valentine\u2019s week so it\u2019s only right Bunny Shaw hit goal number 14 to have her team swooning. Doing the biz with serious big game rizz. City fans were asking \u201c21, can you do something for me\u201d and she delivered. Shaw shanked it to give her team the ultimate Redemption. BS may have taken the headlines but real talk, Alex Greenwood was chief support. Not talking Afrobeats when we say AG is signing \u201cParty No Day Stop\u201d as her side restored the feeling. And if you\u2019re talking about keeping cool in the heat of battle, salute Khiara Keating. A double save in injury time to keep another clean sheet and draw her team level on points at the top of the table. This was a statement performance by City from front to back. Eight games to go and this title race will gown to the Wire. It\u2019s all in the game, yo."}
{"prompt": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored two headed goals for AC Milan in their 3-0 Europa League victory over Rennes.", "completion": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek is showing up and showing out. Bagged two goals in AC Milan\u2019s 3-0 win over Rennes in the Europa League. Six goals in his last eight games. That\u2019s twice as many goals in this year alone than the three he scored in the previous four years combined. His best goalscoring campaign since 2018-19. RLC must stand for Real Lengman\u2019s Comeback. Streets were calling him Cobham\u2019s Kaka, but right now he\u2019s Milan\u2019s maestro. Ruuben Gullit. Two headed goals to make the OG Olivier Giroud jealous. His \u2018too small\u2019 NBA celebration might turn him from playmaker to box-crasher. Strength and skill. Grace and grit. Energy and elegance. Gareth Southgate\u2019s list of midfield options just got longer. R-L-C, he\u2019s running this rap sh*t."}
{"prompt": "A comprehensive celebration of Lionel Messi's distinguished football career, encompassing his numerous club tenures across various teams and his crowning achievement of winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with the Argentine national team.", "completion": "Lionel Messi has been gifted a pair of custom adidas Sambas that celebrate his storied career. Designed by Argentine designer Stepwise, every inch of the pair is filled with details nodding to the different stages of Messi\u2019s life on the pitch.\u2063\n\u2063\n100% hand-painted by the Oakland-based customiser, the \u2018What The Messi\u2019 Sambas are a patchwork of an icon\u2019s footballing odyssey. Taking visual cues from different shirts worn by La Pulga, the custom creps nod to his time at Barcelona, PSG, Newell\u2019s Old Boys and Inter Miami, as well as his successes with the Argentine national team. The iconic Samba tongue is decorated with Messi\u2019s own logo and a 2022 World Cup winner\u2019s patch.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Stepwise has created a pair inspired by the beautiful game\u2019s greatest operator. Back in December, he released the \u2018What The Messi\u2019 Nike SB Dunk Lows for pre-order to the masses. Now, he\u2019s taken it one step further \u2013 customising a pair of the year\u2019s most popular silhouettes for the adidas icon and delivering them by hand."}
{"prompt": "Arsenal Women achieved a historic first by selling out the Emirates Stadium for an upcoming Women's Super League match against Manchester United, setting a new league attendance record.", "completion": "For the first time in their history, Arsenal Women have sold out the Emirates for a WSL match as they take on Manchester United on February 17.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is the second time the team has sold out the Emirates, with the first being their semi-final UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League clash with Wolfsburg last May. Over 60,000 tickets and all hospitality packages have been sold as Arsenal prepare to welcome the Red Devils to North London in front of a full house.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe news comes after consistent high attendances at the Emirates in the WSL this season, with the sell-out overtaking the league\u2019s attendance record previously set by Arsenal earlier this season against Chelsea on December 10.\u2063\n\u2063\nWith the club aiming to play all their matches at the club\u2019s main stadium in the near future, this moment in Arsenal Women\u2019s history is only the beginning. As more women\u2019s sides continue to play matches at their main stadium, not only in the WSL but across the world, more stories like this one are sure to come in the future."}
{"prompt": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 informed Paris Saint-Germain of his decision to leave the club as a free agent at the end of the season, concluding a multi-year transfer saga widely expected to result in a move to Real Madrid.", "completion": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Real Madrid. A transfer saga years in the making might be approaching its final chapter. The 25-year-old is the prized jewel in Paris, but reportedly wants to become the face of the franchise in Madrid. PSG turned down every offer, but KM7 has reportedly told president Nasser Al-Khelaifi he\u2019ll leave the club as a free agent in the summer. One day after Valentine\u2019s Day he\u2019s breaking the hearts of fans in the City of Love. It\u2019s a cold world, but Mbapp\u00e9 is colder. We have one question. If you were in his size 10s, what would you do? Let us know below."}
{"prompt": "The record-breaking transfer of star midfielder Lena Oberdorf from rival club VfL Wolfsburg to Bayern Munich for \u20ac400,000.", "completion": "Bayern Munich just did a sweep. The five-time Frauen-Bundesliga champions have signed Wolfsburg midfield starlet Lena Oberdorf for \u20ac400K. The most expensive transfer for a German player and the most expensive transfer completed by a German club. This is pure, cold-blooded German efficiency at its finest. Snapping up your rivals\u2019 brightest talent in the middle of the season when they\u2019re just one point off you in the table? The type of poaching Gerd Muller would\u2019ve been proud of. There\u2019s cornering the market and then there\u2019s crashing it top bins. Big \u2018if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em\u2019 energy. Streets are calling this the biggest heel turn in women\u2019s football. Chelsea fans might have the blues after missing out on Oberdorf, but Wolfsburg fans will be green with envy. So much love lost just a day after Valentine\u2019s Day. Wolfsburg\u2019s game against Bayern on 23rd March just got even tastier. The Admin will be there no matter what."}
