A product of Manchester United\u2019s academy, the 24-year-old has suffered more than his fair share of injury setbacks and a lack of game time on his journey to his first England call-up. But concerns over his height and physicality have been squashed by interim England manager, Lee Carsley, who has always recognised his abilities at every age of the national team set-up. Now, he\u2019s ready to show the world why he belongs among England\u2019s elite."}

Had a year to remember at Ajax, so the league had to make sure her flowers came right on time. This teen titan\u2019s just getting started and is already one of the biggest names in Europe. Lily\u2019s a record-breaker. The definition of a playmaker. One of the brightest talents to burst on the scene in recent history. Became the youngest player to start a UWCL match back in November. 11 G+A in 20 appearances for the Amsterdam side in 23/24. Moved so comfy on the pitch people had her confused for a club vet. Had a breakthrough so impressive, she skipped the youth international level and earned a spot in Emma Hayes\u2019 USWNT squad. Scored on her debut and put the world on notice. All before her 17th birthday. This is what a generational talent looks like. The only way is up from here, and Lily\u2019s stocks are going through the roof. Invest now before it\u2019s too late."}

People are giving it one star reviews but here\u2019s a spoiler: this will be absolute scenes. We ain\u2019t talking about the sausage roll when we say Nigerians love Gala. The trip from Ikeja to Istanbul is one for national heroes only. Emmanuel Emenike, Joseph Yobo, Ahmed Musa, and the legendary Jay-Jay Okocha to name a few. Now it\u2019s Vic O\u2019s turn to have an After Party following his celebration in Naples. Middle name is James and his stint as King has been going since he was 23. The Super Eagle that reigned supreme in Italy. Ended the drought and won Napoli their first title since the days of Maradona. Notched Serie A POTY. Became the first African to win the coveted Capocannoniere. Came, saw and conquered. 76 goals in 133 games. Dominance personified. Africa\u2019s Player of the Year. They\u2019ll say he fell off the pace last season but 15 goals in the league says otherwise. Now his latest assignment is to fend off a Fener team powered by Jos\u00e9. Naija boy vs Naija mentality. If you like sweet treats, this viewing will be a Turkish Delight. The Admin will be locked in."}

Spent a year abroad in Madrid, but this Matilda\u2019s back on the WSL\u2019s books. Odds are on Spurs causing headaches this season. This is a certified winner. A game-changer in every sense of the word. Decisive goals are her bread and butter. Whether it\u2019s an NWSL Championship or the world\u2019s biggest stage. This Aussie always delivers. Spent a few years in blue, but after a season with Las Blancas, she\u2019s decided Lilywhite is her colour. The North London club just topped off the transfer window with a bow. Pay close attention to N17 this season. This baller is more than just ribbons and sunshine. DRIP on her training kit so it\u2019s only right she\u2019s about to make it rain. HR\u2019s well-versed in hitman relations, and she\u2019s ready to raise hell in the WSL."}

Crashed home a hatty in Barca\u2019s 7-0 win over Real Valladolid. Make that 3G + 3A in his first four league games of the season. These are name brand numbers from a baller who\u2019s gone under the radar. This is what it looks like to make sure the masses remember your name. La Masia stays churning out wonderkids, but Raphinha\u2019s smooth with it like butter. Yamal is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s shiniest new toy, but real ones know Raphinha\u2019s story is creating a Buzz right now. Looked like his time at the Catalonian club might\u2019ve been running out, but now he\u2019s runnin\u2019 up them numbers. This is how you show your YG the ropes and get the work like a PT. EA Sports FC sponsors La Liga and Raphinha\u2019s treating it like UT with Unreal Tek. It makes sense that a manager called Flick is getting the most out of this jugador. Wreck it Raph is here to bruk up the competition. Stay indoors."}

One of England\u2019s brightest young talents just traded her Chelsea Blues for green and white. After a close brush with glory last season, Lisbon\u2019s lions are on the hunt to end Benfica\u2019s era of dominance, and they tapped up the right Lioness to turn As \u00c1guias into prey. This young baller\u2019s next up for England\u2019s setup, already making her mark at youth level. Taking the big leap abroad at 18, RB\u2019s ready to assert her dominance, and she\u2019s about to put the world on notice. Sporting\u2019s been doing business quietly all summer, but Bose\u2019s signing just put their intentions on loudspeaker. With a squad full of youngstars, it\u2019s best not to sleep on what this team can do. With Ria in their ranks, the league\u2019s about to look real scary. Watch this space."}

You\u2019re looking at the fourth Madrid player in history to open his scoring account with two. And the withdrawal has Los Blancos fans laughing to the bank. Word to AJ, the first one was so nice, he had to do it twice. Heard all the chattings on his name and clapped back the only way a true No.9 knows how. Making the net ring like a Whatsapp call. This is how you step into the limelight and make things dark for your opps. To step into a team of world beaters and stand on business. Had Jude doing up \u2018VAMOS\u2019 from the stands. Anyone asking if KM9 has scored a free kick should know the best strikers don\u2019t need set pieces to move the streets. Forget what you heard. Kylian can\u2019t be stopped. Madrid\u2019s newest marksman is an Mbagsman for the ages."}

Make that four goals in his first three games of the season to lift PSG to the top of the table. You wanna talk about elevation? He\u2019s already matched his goal tally in Ligue 1 from last season in the first month of the new campaign. This ain\u2019t just greedy. It\u2019s an appetite for ascension. KM used to feast in the Uber Eats but this McDonald\u2019s sponsorship has transformed Barcola into PSG\u2019s ba-da-ba-ba-bagsman. Pulled up to Lille\u2019s gaff just to Drive Thru. Told their full-back \u201cjust put the fries in the bag, bro.\u201d Flew the flag for his country like K\u2019naan this summer. Now, the lion of Lyon is roaring loudly in the capital. Tourists come to see the light show at the Eiffel Tower. But if Bradley keeps these performances up, he\u2019ll become the main attraction. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien."}

They thought this team would fade away but they remain dishing out fades like A Star Barber. Had Erik ten Hag saying \u201cI ain\u2019t Harry Potter\u201d but Arne Slot\u2019s looking like a wizard. The first manager to achieve a perfect record in their first three Premier League games since the late Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson\u2019s Man City in 2007. Kloppball was Rock and Roll but Slotball has the opposition doing the stop, drop and roll. Pure fire. Luis D\u00edaz is channeling the spirit of savagery whilst rocking a bandage on his wrist. Mo Salah\u2019s dropping dimes like a jeweller. Ryan Gravenberch looking like Yaya Tour\u00e9 the way he\u2019s running up the field with grace. VVD is showing he\u2019s still VVS when it comes to defending. Nike Swoosh on their kit pointing up and their performances keep doing the same too. Put the word out. The Reds are rampant."}

The Admin\u2019s running out of bars to describe this bagsmania. Back to back hat-tricks? How GREEDY. 70 goals in 69 Premier League games. The first player to score seven in the first three games of the season. No other Premier League TEAM has more. Pro Clubs numbers from a striker who looks like he\u2019s playing on amateur mode. This is the definition of built different. Anyone tryna go machine for machine with EH9 will malfunction. This robot\u2019s chip ain\u2019t on his shoulder, it\u2019s in his brain. Haters say he isn\u2019t fun to watch. Real ones know brutal efficiency doesn\u2019t come with rainbow flicks. We are watching the best goalscorer to touch this league leave his fingerprints on all the scoring charts in real-time. Best believe he ain\u2019t gonna raw dog a 90 minute game with no G+A any time soon. All that time Pep played with a false nine. Word to Nas, now he Got Himself A Gun. If you ain\u2019t got Haaland in your FPL team, just double tap this and keep scrolling. The Erling Era is upon us. Learn to live with it."}

Bagged the goal to spark a dramatic 3-2 win over Everton. That\u2019s now 2G + 1A in his first three PL games to light up Bournemouth\u2019s start to the season. Pulled up to Goodison Park with bad intentions. This might just look like a player in form to the untrained eye. But look closer and you will see a player full of class. Real ones know this late comeback was Bournemouth heritage. But it was Antoine\u2019s goal that got the ball rolling. Summer\u2019s almost over but this baller right here is what fullbacks call a long day. Pace. Power. Panache. Can drift left or cut right. Can rass it from range and carry it into the box. Grabs games by the scruff of the neck so you know he\u2019s a handful. We ain\u2019t seen a Ghanaian bagsman in the PL this potent since Asamoah Gyan. But best believe this Black Star is going sky high. When it comes to forwards, Bournemouth know how to Cherry-pick them. Now Semenyo\u2019s the Cherry on top."}

Kennington where it started. King\u2019s Road where he\u2019s about to get it popping wholehearted. This one-time prince of European football is ready to get his crown back. Supported Chelsea as a boy and now he\u2019s due to pay that love back on the pitch. Sometimes when things don\u2019t go to plan, it\u2019s best to follow your heart. Best know this Harlem Spartan is about to scream 300 for the Shed End. You already know the truth. Jadon at his best moves like Bossman at Morley\u2019s the way he dishes out 3 piece combos. This ain\u2019t just about reviving the vibe, it\u2019s about restoring order. Never underestimate a baller with a point to prove. Has always deserved to play at the top level and Chelsea have given him the platform to Bridge that gap. Make sure you watch closely. A few games in you\u2019ll see True Blues screaming \u201cF what bro done, that\u2019s my jigga\u201d like Loski. Might\u2019ve spent some time in the wilderness.

Plays in DM but Does More than just shield the back line. Completed the most dribbles. Won the most tackles. Racked up 100% pass completion. They say the Championship is a league for seasoned vets but this 19-year-old is taking charge. Derby fans will be rubbing their hands together like Birdman because Ozoh is Cash Money. Wears the No.4 and plays with Vieira\u2019s vim. But you don\u2019t need any Vicks to smell what DO4 is about to cook this season. Some of the Prem\u2019s best ballers got first class honours in the second division. Now Ozoh is due to pass with flying colours. Class is in session."}

Bagged two goals and raised hell against the Saints. That\u2019s now 3G for a baller who knows how to make the net work. Only Haaland has more in the league. Every PL team needs a bagsman. A certified hitman. Someone who can wake things up and put games to bed. Mbeumo just proved he\u2019s that guy for Brentford. Toney might\u2019ve dipped to Saudi, but Bryan\u2019s still saucin\u2019 on defenders in west London. This is what it looks like to step into the spotlight and when things get dark. We\u2019re witnessing a dangerous forward in action. Creates chances and finishes them. Can link-up with teammates and lock off games. Mbeumo and Wissa are TW8\u2019s Trecherous Twins. The Gtek\u2019s got a new genius. Bryan\u2019s got the Bees buzzin. Mbeumo hive stand up."}

The papers said he was frozen out of training. The streets will say he\u2019s heating up Selhurst Park. Whenever this baller has left home comforts, he\u2019s always delivered like an Uber Eats rider trying to get five stars. IYKYK. He mowed over green pastures when at Ipswich.

Came off the bench and bagged a brace to secure a 4-3 comeback win for Lyon. Two goals in ten minutes. This is what it looks like to live up to your name. The best gift givers don\u2019t need a special occasion. The best present a No.9 can give is goals right now and that\u2019s exactly what Orban\u2019s on. Elite bagsmen don\u2019t always need the full 90 to hit the right angles. When it comes to rapping Chances, you don\u2019t want No Problem with Gift. This Cameo was so sweet, it had Lyon ultras doing the Candy dance. If you didn\u2019t know before, GO9 really does what it says on the tin. The garri Gerd Muller. The suya super-sub. Benue State\u2019s own Benzema. Whatever you call him, just call it correct. Orban\u2019s Gift is about to have Lyon living lavish. Make sure you\u2019re locked in to this breakout season."}

Just know Raz is gonna be screaming \u201cMad Out\u201d like Valiant. The last time he linked up with Mikel? 53 goal contributions. No agendas, just facts. They tried to rub the boy out but you can\u2019t erase history. The only current PL player with more G+A is Mo Salah. A member of the 100 PL goals club. Since 12/13, he\u2019s only failed to crack double figures once. Watch this king fling on the Jamaica jacket and act like he\u2019s at home in Kingston. About to make the Emirates his yard and let crocodile teeth fly like he\u2019s Skillibeng. Edu got the deal done overnight and said Thank yuh Jah fi wake me up this morning.

One of Hale End\u2019s finest has spread his wings and flown back home to South East London. Palace may have a few Crystals in their team, but Glasner just unearthed a diamond. Now it\u2019s time for him to shine brightly. Real ones know he\u2019s notched 16 goals in 38 PL starts. Realer ones know that if he gets a run of games, he\u2019ll show the world what he\u2019s truly about. Once a goalscorer, always a goalscorer. The way that phone is gonna ring off, you\u2019d have thought he opened a call centre. Arsenal are all guns blazing currently but Eddie\u2019s contribution to this moment should not be forgotten. During 21/22, he was part of the side that nearly rescued top four \u2013 including that brace against Chelsea. Next season he bagged goals when called upon, including a brace against United. Still remains the only player to clap a hat-trick for Arsenal since Aubameyang left the Emirates. Whilst this marks the end of one journey, it\u2019s also the start of a new one. They say there\u2019s no place like home and best believe Eddie is going to look comfy at his. Bank on this Black Star shooting off into a new orbit. Your defence is in trouble."}

This young Black Brit in Italian kit is about to eat Gucci and Fendi in the fashion capital. The Admin might start calling this club Chelsea Italia with the amount of former blues on their books, but real ones know Tammy can make them the Pride of Milan once again. From smashing up loan spells to breaking the No.9 curse for his boyhood Chelsea. Performing like a true gladiator in his first season in Italy notching 27 goals to winning the Conference League with Jos\u00e9. This is a man who\u2019s manifested greatness time and time again. Don\u2019t let an injury-ridden season make you feel otherwise. If Tammy plays, Tammy scores. Milan just landed a top striker. Watch him paint the town red."}

One of United\u2019s own is leaving home to embark on an Italian adventure. Once Conte made the bird call, McTom had to leave the nest and take his career to the heights it deserves. But when United runs through your blood, none of your bangers go in vain. Let\u2019s not forget Scott\u2019s Greatest Hits. That two-piece he hit Leeds with in the 2nd and 3rd minute in 20/21. The 40-yard screamer against City to seal a 2-0 derby day dub. The two stoppage-time goals off the bench against Brentford to send OT to the moon like ET. When it comes to deciding games, Scotty 2 Hotty has ice in his veins. When it\u2019s time to lock in, McTom knows how to break games wide open. Haters called him a \u2018teacher\u2019s pet\u2019. But the only animal The Admin sees is dawg. And this Dalmatian is about to earn his spot in a top team. From a YG to a captain, McTom has done it all at United. But the next chapter is about to hit. Serie A is about to witness the coldest knee slider in the game. McSauce might have left Manneh but he\u2019s about to be mustard in Naples."}

Just set a new record for the most goals any Tigres player has scored in a single match, men\u2019s or women\u2019s, and she\u2019s only 24. This might be the first time you\u2019re hearing her name, but make no mistake, this wasn\u2019t pure luck. Ovalle\u2019s not your ordinary baller. Hails from Aguascalientes, so you know she puts defenders in boiling hot water every time she steps on the pitch. Look her up and you\u2019ll see banger after banger, golazo after golazo. Scored four goals in ten minutes just before the half to send Tigres roaring into the break. Midweek f\u00fatbol has never looked so good. Stars like this don\u2019t come around often, so it\u2019s only right to give this No.14 her tens right now. Barely in her prime and already racked up 226 caps for Las Amazonas. Over 100 goals to her name. Liga MX has a hidden gem in their ranks, and it\u2019s time for the world to wake up and smell the horchata. This jugadora\u2019s going straight to the top."}

Everyone raised their eyebrows when he made the move to La Liga in the summer. Now The Admin\u2019s raising a glass to his efforts. Call him the Buckfast Batistuta. The Canary Islands Cantona. The easyJet Eusebio. Went from looking like a polar bear in Arlington, Texas to a baller in his natural habitat. Turned up against the brightest talents in the world and never once flinched at the diamond tester. Haters had Las Palmas going down to the second division last season. But real ones know with McBurnie up top, anything\u2019s possible in 24/25. From cheffing up in the Steel City to cooking in the Canaries. The Irn Bru bagsman is officially outside."}

We ain\u2019t talking about the imminent game release when we say FC is gonna be the talk of the town. Some have tried to say he\u2019s finished, but this move to the Kop End is about to be a fresh new start. Don\u2019t get it twisted. This is still one of the most exciting forwards in Europe. Notched double figures in goals for the first time in two seasons post his cruciate ligament injury. Before that, everyone knew what time he was on. Those performances at the Euros had him putting defenders in a blender like he was trying to make a smoothie. If you saw those moments on the jumbotron, just know that you\u2019re gonna see much more of that on MOTD very soon. Might have rocked the Jeep sponsor on his Juve kit but he\u2019s about to look like a Ferrari in the red of Liverpool. A 1v1 demon with the grace of an angel. Parts defences like Moses did the Red Sea. Football fans always talk about investing stocks but Liverpool have played a masterclass in buying the dip.

Bossed the U23s for Uncle Titi, now it\u2019s time to be a main man for Grandpa Deschamps. It\u2019s crazy to think that a few seasons ago this baller was plying his trade in the Championship.

They tried to delay the premiere of this movie but he just put on a hell of a show for his Barcelona debut. As far as introductions go, you\u2019ll find it hard to top this anytime soon. One of the coldest debuts in recent times. Pure jugador-ing. Subbed into the game at half-time and said \u201cthe game is mine\u201d like C Biz. Changed the whole flow of events. He literally popped out and showed brothers. Smashed the crossbar from distance, notched the match winner and secured Man of the Match. All in an evening\u2019s work. This wasn\u2019t just about bagging the winner though, this was restoring the feeling. Had the Culers screaming \u201cthis is what a Barcelona player looks like.\u201d You know he was on mission when you saw him hit the Dame Lillard celebration. Real ones know Dame Time means \u201cnight night\u201d so it\u2019s only right Olmo put Rayo Vallecano to bed. He left La Masia as a boy, but he\u2019s returned to this team to be the man. Tap in."}

Bagged two goals in four minutes against the Central African Republic because sometimes you don\u2019t have to long it out. Just get straight to the kitchen and start cooking with the big spoon. Add that to the 1G + 2A in his last three games for Monaco and it\u2019s clear this baller is breaking out for the top spot. But this ain\u2019t just about his numbers. Ben Seghir passes the eye test with flying colours. This is a YG who Yearns for Greatness with every touch. North Africa is known for producing tekky players and EBS is no different. Bringing that cage football vim to the international stage. An FC Rush player IRL who rushes his opps in more ways than one. Left foot or right foot. Dribble and shoot or first-time finish. The outcome will always be the same. Cash money. Big Ben is one to watch. His time is now."}

Came off the bench to make his international debut for Malta and won the penalty to secure the dub against Moldova. This ain\u2019t your regular breakout story. This is the stuff of parental paradise. Basil\u2019s building a career no one can Brush off. Anyone who missed out on Project Mbapp\u00e9 might want to start Operation Tuma. Might play for Reading, but Tuma\u2019s already done enough to rewrite the script. Most people have to choose between the boots or the books, but Tuma is here to show you can choose both. Born in Uganda, raised in the UK and already showing he doesn\u2019t falter for Malta. The start has been fun, but the best is yet to come."}

But anyone who\u2019s peeped him on the pitch knows his profile is peak. A MF with More Flavour than most. Drifts into pockets and knows how to leave with somethin\u2019 like a thief in the night. They say \u201cfirst impressions are everything\u201d and Nanasi is ballin\u2019 with that firm handshake grip. Forget making yourself part of the furniture, SN15 is building his name from scratch like he copped it from IKEA. Flat packing and stat padding. This baller\u2019s making Chelsea fans develop a taste for Swedish meatballs even though there\u2019s rice at home. One thing\u2019s for certain though, Nanasi is making sure everyone\u2019s fed."}

Dynamic duos are back in full effect. We could talk about Elisabeth starting her royal reign of Manchester United with a bang. But we would be doing an injustice without mentioning the jewel in her crown: CB. Two goals against Spurs saw Terland get off the mark for the Red Devils. With her Norwegian counterpart providing heavenly crosses for both moments, too. Nothing but \u2018to me, to you\u2019 hours. For every whip from Bizet, Terland made sure she had some dip. You haven\u2019t seen a cash money combo like this for United since Ashley Young used to feed Fellaini for fun. Real football heritage before your eyes. A pinpoint cross for a volley followed by a targeted delivery for a header. ET19 and CB15 are future cult heroes. Not talking about the film when we say ET is extra-terrestrial. She ain\u2019t no rapper but C.Biz is making the game hers right now. If their performances are anything to go by, these two will turn Leigh Sports Village into Valhalla.

Had Gareth Thomas saying \u201cgratitude is a must\u201d when the ball touched the back of the net. Make that three goals in her first four games this season. We ain\u2019t talking about the Norwegian striker when we say Manchester City have a generational forward in their ranks. And we ain\u2019t talking about Titi when we say beware when you see this baller pull on the black gloves. Bunny Shaw stays hopping over expectations.

Two years and four surgeries later, she just made her 100th NWSL appearance and sealed the deal with a goal. The celebration said it all. This was more than just a stoppage time golazo. The league just witnessed the return of a national treasure. An NWSL icon and a living USWNT legend. Had her first season in Los Angeles cut short by injury, but this angel just got her wings back. In the words of Tobin Heath, this was a vintage CP23 performance. A quick dribble into the box and a shot that had ears ringing across the country.

If you\u2019re not already familiar with TC\u2019s game, here\u2019s a two-word summary: Too. Cold. This is the definition of an all-around baller. A No. 9 by nature that can kickstart an attack like a 10 and defend like a world-class CB. Signed with Kansas City in January and had already pulled The Current out of the trenches by June. Became the first player in the league to score in eight consecutive matches. The first player to score in 15 different matches in a single season. And those are just records from this year. Racked up 63 goals to her name in 2023 alone to become the year\u2019s leading goalscorer \u2013 the first African woman to do so. A Scorcher from birth, and she\u2019s not done burning up the competition yet. Balling out in the same city as Mahomes, but there\u2019s a new MVP in town and she\u2019s just getting started."}

This baller right here is sonning Father Time. Call him E.T. the way he\u2019s hooping in the extra time of his career. 39 years and still answering his nation\u2019s call as the best player on the pitch. Took Scotland to school as one of the game\u2019s longest serving teachers. Who needs goal involvements when you\u2019re involved in everything else? 11 passes into the final third. Eight duels won. Six interceptions. Three tackles. Four take-ons. Three chances created. One vintage performance to remind the streets only the best can ball at this age. Close enough to 40 that you\u2019d think he\u2019s Drake. But to anyone who doubted his level, If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late. What\u2019s a Tartan Army to a midfield general? This vet is a whole different animal. Put up the type of performance that\u2019ll convince oldheads they still might have it. Turning back the clocks and still spinning his opps out their socks. 181 caps is no joke. Of all the international games Croatia have played since their independence, Modri\u0107 has played more than half. This is the purest example that class never dies. It just matures.

This baller is the complete package who always knows how to deliver. Pace. Poise. Precision. And she\u2019s been pushin\u2019 P all season. That\u2019s now 2G + 2A in four games for Chelsea this season. But this game was the perfect example of how you stress out an entire defence on your ones. Real \u2018run up, get done up\u2019 hours. Anyone trying to knock her off the ball got their bell rung. Running through the channels like she was trying to find something to watch and put on a show of her own. Makes sense that the tekkiest player on the pitch barked off her Technical+ playstyle. The Colombian striker fried the Gunners\u2019 back line like an empanada and had Chelsea fans shouting \u2018wepa!\u2019. If you didn\u2019t know before, now you do.

Bolivia beat Colombia 1-0 and the moment arrived thanks to a wonder-strike from this wonderkid. Cut inside, feinted and finished with his left like a prime Robben. Less talk about the opposition not being able to deal with the altitude, and how about we start dealing with this baller\u2019s attitude? This golazo was the definition of mean and green. La Verde have now won three competitive games for the first time in 27 years, and it\u2019s no shock o Miguelito has played his part in all of those wins. Make that three goals in three games against Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. Not even 21 yet but he\u2019s moving like a real Savage on the international stage. The maddest part is that he still plays most of his football for Santos\u2019 U20s. Load up your FM saves and sign him. Contact your local comp maker and submit a request.

The former Sheffield United full-back represented Greece on 12 occasions following his first call-up to the national side in 2022. After Vangelis Pavlidis scored his country\u2019s first-ever goal at Wembley last night, the whole team paid tribute to George by raising his shirt and pointing to their black armbands. The team\u2019s performance epitomised Baldock as a player. Determination and giving your all for 90 minutes, even if you\u2019re the underdog. His passing serves as a timely reminder that every moment is precious. Whilst we all love the game, this is an example of how beautiful it can be. Sending strength and power to this team and everyone connected to George."}

First time Harder\u2019s touched a UWCL scoresheet in almost two years but still left her fingerprints all over this game. A perfect hat-trick for a perfect performance. That\u2019s now 38 goals in 50 Champions League games for four different clubs. A true bagswoman everywhere she goes. Her body of work is head and shoulders above the field, so it makes sense how she can keep rising it at the top level. Used to play for Chelsea but her goals still come like London buses.

You won\u2019t find many other examples of siblings doing it big on bigger stages than these two. We\u2019re talking about a duo who were African champions together. A duo who have lifted the Premier League on the same team and on their own. Their ascendancy from Abidjan would see them become African giants. Both got their start at ASEC Mimosas, an Ivorian club based in their hometown. Kolo would soon go on to join Arsenal in 2002, and in August of that year faced up in a pre-season friendly against his younger brother Yaya, who had joined Belgian side Beveren. The rest was history. Unapologetically themselves, both brothers would go on to achieve greatness in the game.

We ain\u2019t taking about the film when we say Annabelle created some terrifying moments for the opposition. Notched a brace that will make the whole league feel this side\u2019s taken off. Flight mode activated. Silenced the doubters with some clinical precision in front of goal. Finessed her first shot before cooly converting a pen for her second. AB has always made it easy to C why she\u2019s a top baller. 11 goals in the Championship was her warm up. Three games into the top flight and she\u2019s already notched two. Now watch this 23-year-old and her team start soaring to even greater heights."}

We haven\u2019t seen a hitman move this scary since The Wire. Might not be pulling up in a trenchcoat but defenders are feeling it when they see Omar coming. His stoppage time equaliser against Bayern Munich is what made the headlines. But you need to deep the full story. You\u2019re looking at the top scorer in the Bundesliga this season. A brace and assist in a 3-3 against Vincent Kompany\u2019s men makes it twelve goal contributions in total. Eight goals. Four assists. In only six matches. Potent. Frankfurt are nicknamed the Eagles, and this baller is moving like an apex predator. Word to Randy Orton. He\u2019s dishing out RKOs left, right and centre. Joined on a free but this superstar is showing that he\u2019s Money In The Bank. Invest your stocks before it\u2019s too late."}

One of the best DMs in the world just sent everyone a message: she can put up numbers too. Bagged 2G + 1A in Barcelona\u2019s 8-1 demolition of Madrid CFF in a POTM performance. Scored two league goals in two years in Spain. Now she\u2019s matched that tally in one match. From tempo-setter to shadow striker. When you\u2019ve got as much class as Keira, you can\u2019t be put in a box. Adding another string to her bow and hitting the target with ease. Popping up in the final third like the final boss. Her assist for Pajor had so much disguise the Madrid defenders were wondering if Halloween came early. Add that to two finishes that are gonna start some serious conversations about KW21\u2019s standing in the game. We know she can pick a pass. But now she\u2019s picking corners for fun too? It\u2019s about to get long. Just in time for her former club Manchester City in the Champions League midweek. Rochdale\u2019s Regista or Bar\u00e7a\u2019s box-crasher.

God\u2019s child faced up against the Saints and went biblical. 1G and 2A to load up a 3-1 win for the Gunners. Went a goal down at home but this player never lost faith. Call it divine intervention. Lines up alongside Jesus and Gabriel but BS7 is the one handing out blessings. More assists than any other player in Europe\u2019s top five leagues so far this season. Seventh heaven like the number on his back. Three points closer to the holy grail."}

Only 18-years-old and already serving up cash money finishes. Came off the bench for the Seagulls but stood on business. Bagged Brighton\u2019s fourth goal in stoppage time to make sure Aston Villa checked out of the game. The rage quit special. She was only on the pitch for 13 minutes but best believe this was her lucky day. Five touches. One shot. One goal. Maximum efficiency. Came through Arsenal\u2019s academy, so it makes sense why she\u2019s such a comfy shooter. Might be on loan but this Gunner still doesn\u2019t miss. The talent is already VVS.

This baller\u2019s really cheffing it up in Sheffield. Bagged a brace on his birthday and celebrated in more ways than one. Turned 22 and served Luton two slices of cake with no napkin. How impolite. Anyone who was sleeping on this talent just got a rude awakening. Four dribbles completed. Two chances created. Nine duels won. And a performance to show Palace fans they\u2019ve got a Crystal clear talent on their books. This one had The Admin doing the Pardew skank. Get you a winger who can cut inside and out with the same vim. It gets sticky both ways like some double sided tape. We are witnessing the rise of one of the most electrifying young ballers this country has to offer. Chopped 15G + 8A for Charlton last season. Now he\u2019s cheffing man up in the Championship. Invest your stocks while you still can."}
{"prompt": "Nikita Parris, in her first Women's Super League start for Brighton, scored an equalizing goal and provided an assist for the winning goal against Aston Villa.", "completion": "Nikita Parris is Brighton\u2019s newest spark.

Then set up Pauline Bremer to leave Villa fans\u2019 stomachs in knots. Known for her speed, but this baller hit the ground running and hit Aston Villa with the \u201cmeep meep\u201d. Critics raised their eyebrows when she joined from Man United in the summer. Now they\u2019re raising a glass to Parris like they\u2019re on a romantic retreat. But this is the kind of instant impact you have to love. Who needs a bedding in period when you been putting defenders to sleep for 10+ years? Brighton\u2019s attacking options run deep, but Nikita\u2019s bag is deeper. Popping up all over the pitch and getting it crackin\u2019 like a chiropractor to make sure there was no way back for the Villans. If you didn\u2019t know, now you do. Parris is still peak."}

Slot into a deeper midfield role that Arne carved out for him and started cutting shapes ever since. This is the kind of transformation Optimus was doing in his Prime. From squaddie to stylin\u2019 on every pitch he\u2019s touched this season. RG is Regulating Guys. Drops a shoulder like prime Russ Millions and knows how to use his Body-ody to protect the ball. Half-turns on full violence. Real \u201cnothing\u2019s over there\u201d hours. This MF is a Rolls Royce who Ghosts pasts his opps for fun. So press-resistant that the media ain\u2019t even caught on yet. Gravenberch got his markers grabbin\u2019 shirts. South London might be known as the Concrete Catalonia but Ryan bopped through and showed Palace what Dutch Delicacy looks like. This is ain\u2019t the first masterclass and it won\u2019t be the last.

The Red Devils needed heavenly intervention in order to avoid defeat following this bagsman\u2019s brace. A masterclass in popping up and showing brothers. Five shots. Five duels won. Three shots on target. Two goals. Boss moves. Make that seven goals in his last six games for Porto. The 20-year-old is moving mythical for the Dragons. Went up against De Light and had him seeing the dark. Real ones know that Nigerians no day carry last but this guy was first to every single ball. Pounded his finishes into the net like he was trying to make the softest yam to box off with some efo. Left United in serious stew like they were assorted meat. Formerly of Atl\u00e9ti, now representing for Porto. The striker bloodline of both clubs alone means he was only ever rising to the top.

Lacazette and Cherki might receive all the plaudits at Lyon but Fofana said it\u2019s morphing time and levelled up. Make that three goals in his last two matches including a last-minute match winner against Toulouse. You wanna talk about ballin\u2019 outta of control?

This time, all three jerseys are getting a one-off shirt sponsor change with New York\u2019s pizza-loving heroes front and centre. A mutation, if you will.\n\nThe home and third kits feature a graphic of Leonardo\u2019s face in white and black, replacing the Paramount+ logo that usually graces the front of Inter\u2019s shirts. The away jersey, however, has all four Ninja Turtles emblazoned across the middle - individual masks and all.\n\nLike the Transformers release, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo will all be pitch-side at San Siro before Inter debuts the new kit on March 4.\n\nThe TMNT kits are available to purchase via Inter\u2019s online store now."}

Don\u2019t let the scoreline fool you. This was an epic clash of European giants. Think Don Quixote vs The Count of Monte Cristo. Rosal\u00eda vs Aya Nakamura. In the end, Les Bleues were no match for La Roja. As always, Blaugrana ballers were front and centre in another Spanish victory. Herencia del f\u00fatbol. Aitana Bonmat\u00ed put the Spaniards in front 30 minutes in. Mariona Caldentey put the match to bed 20 minutes later. Light work. The world champions lifted their second trophy in less than a year, and only their second major title in history. This side\u2019s stock just keeps going up. If you aren\u2019t already invested, better open up that Robinhood app. La Roja on target has the whole world seeing red. They say heavy is the head that wears the crown, but these crimson queens make it look easy. Spain is sitting comfy at the top, and nobody\u2019s been able to dethrone them yet.

Bagged a brace against Southampton to secure Liverpool\u2019s route to the FA Cup QFs. Knockout artist. Make that three games, two goals and one trophy in 7 Days. That\u2019s what you call Born To Do It. The Saints went marching into Anfield but got turfed out by the Kop\u2019s new landlord. Not many knew this hitman\u2019s name when he sent Chelsea spinning on Sunday, but there\u2019s no denying his claim on the game right now. JD\u2019s sport has got the streets locked.

Hopped out of retirement to score four goals and send the Matildas to the Olympics, and prove she\u2019s still got it. Her first start for Australia in 2,183 days. Don\u2019t call it a comeback. Took the field at the Marvel Stadium so you know Michelle had to turn into Hawkeye in front of goal. Walked into that Tillies\u2019 dressing room like she had all six infinity stones and made sure it was Endgame in the first half. 11 minutes. That\u2019s how long it took for this sniper to score a hat-trick. Might as well change her surname from Heyman to Hitman the way she never misses. Scored her fourth just before half-time and let her teammates finish the job. Might be a Matilda but she was moving like Trunchbull last night. Who\u2019s she gonna put in the chokey next?"}

The Americans may have dominated possession but \u200b\u200bPedro Lopez\u2019s team had more hits than Selena y Los Dinos last night. California girl Mayra Pelayo-Bernal launched a rocket from outside the box in stoppage time to get the whole crowd screaming \u201c\u00a1\u00d3rale!\u201d as the girls in green topped their group with a bang.

A bad run of results must have activated his Spidey-sense as he bagged his first career hat-trick and saved the day. Delivered two well within 30 minutes but still made sure it was three. A picture-perfect performance that deserves to be front page of the Daily Bugle. JB knows with great power comes great responsibility. Make that 14 goals in the league this season. Only Salah and Haaland have more. From non-league to balling out in the Premier League. Brentford should have known they were in trouble when they heard DJ Spider Radgie blazing from the home changing room. It was only right that Bowen brought the celebrations on pitch. The MC might make M\u00e1kina for the massive but Bowen is proving that West Ham are still massive."}

His performances this season have taken him into a new stratosphere. Ain\u2019t talking about the anime when we say Taki is an Astro Boy. Just cooked up another wonderful meal in France, and this time he sprinkled some clutch gene into the recipe. A stoppage-time winner after roasting Lens all game. A brace in the process. Moses parted the Red Sea but Monaco\u2019s magicien parted the yellow wall as he cut into Lens\u2019 defence before firing home. Make that six goals and five assists already this season. It\u2019s only right that he\u2019s feasting in the Uber Eats. Might rep for the Samurai Blue but this noble warrior is putting the opposition to the sword. What\u2019s Japanese for jugador?"}

The Reds draw first blood and pick up the season\u2019s first trophy. An against all odds W to kickstart Klopp\u2019s final victory lap. Came up against Boehly\u2019s Billion Pound Blues and told them \u201cyou know the price of everything but the value of nothing\u201d. When you\u2019re talking about the importance of team spirit, reload this tape. LFC arrived at Wembley without the big hitters but JK packed up a potion that had Chelsea feeling Hazey. The Kop were screaming \u201cwhat you gonna do?\u201d and Klopp\u2019s Tots answered \u201cmake your dreams come true\u201d. Bradley, Clark, McConnell, Danns and Quansah unlocked instant cult hero status but it was a certified legend who led them through the fire. One time for Virgil van Dijk. Knew his opps are all about \u201cCaptain, Leader, Legend\u201d so showed them what one looks like in 2024. VVD turned KIG to go Head, Shoulders, Kneez and Toez above everyone in the 118th minute. An all-time player with an all-time moment. Fantasy football."}
{"prompt": "A crucial late goal scored by Omari Hutchinson for Ipswich Town in a Championship match, significantly bolstering their team's promotion bid.", "completion": "Omari Hutchinson is putting the champ in Championship. Grabbed a late goal for the Tractor Boys to keep their promotion push motoring on. Make that three goals and two assists in his last five games to show why everything is adding up just like his shirt sponsor. Let this be a lesson to every young baller forging their own path. Twice released by CFC, now back with the Blues and doing a madness on loan in the EFL. This is a shooter who\u2019s aiming On Purpose, With Purpose and now the world Ghetts it. This Reggae Boy is ready to be a no.1 hit. Just watch him spin."}

Calvin Bassey also scored for Fulham in a result marking their first winning goal at Old Trafford since 2003.", "completion": "Fulham have no manners. This team just turned the Theatre of Dreams into the Playhouse of Fun. Notched a last gasp winner in Fergie Time like it\u2019s their own flex. The away team are supposed to be guests, but this 2-1 win has them looking like Hollowman. Real Landlord Hours. Silva\u2019s side\u2019s away form has been looking like copper all season but finally, a gold-standard performance has landed. It only needed two Super Eagles to take flight. Bassey with the first and Iwobi with the second. First name Calvin but let\u2019s keep it brief like his phone call to his mum. This finish was bonkers. And we ain\u2019t talking about tech when we say AI is taking over the timeline right now. The first Fulham player to score a winning goal at OT since Steed Malbranque in 2003. May have been doubted recently but he just screamed \u201cthanks for hating\u201d like Potter Payper. They try and say he looks like an NSG member, but real ones know this OT Bop is super sweet. Innit Boys stocks going up like a crescendo."}
{"prompt": "A 17-year-old Archie Gray scored a last-minute winning goal for Leeds United against Leicester City in a pivotal Championship fixture, significantly impacting the league title race.", "completion": "Archie Gray wants the game to remember his name. The 17-year-old starboy just span the Championship title race on its head with one swing of his left boot. Haters will put deflection tax on his winner. Real ones know it\u2019s time to Faes facts on this baller\u2019s destiny. His father, grandfather and great uncle have already pulled on the famous white shirt, so it only makes sense the Elland Road Reigns is following his Bloodline. Marching on Together rung out pre match and this son of the soil said \u201clet me stamp my mark\u201d. I Predict A Riot blared through the speakers at FT so it\u2019s only right AG22 did a madness just before. Real Gray\u2019s Anatomy hours the way this star sent limbs flying right at the death. Might not be able to buy a pint yet but this hometown hero just ran it back to the Strongbow days in style. Call this story football heritage. Call it fate. Just make sure you see it for what it is. Archie Gray is ready to paint the town white. It\u2019s time to join the party."}
{"prompt": "Grace Clinton scored her first international goal on her debut for the England women's national team.", "completion": "Grace Clinton just put the game on notice.

We aren\u2019t talking Clinton\u2019s Cards when we say this baller is a handwritten gift to the game. Grace by name, Ladoja by game the way she\u2019s managing her way to Greatness Only. Shutdown the WSL with six G/A, more completed dribbles and more duels won than anyone else in the league. Clinton\u2019s moving presidential at only 20-years-old but the best is yet to come. No. 8 on her back. Old school finish giving No. 9. You\u2019re looking at an England debut that scored a perfect 10. Stargirl status loading."}

Decided to let one fly and ended up making the whole stadium scream \u201coh my gosh\u201d. This goal was Dirty-ty. Some tried to say that UCL nights make them feel sleepy but this baller just screamed \u201cwake the fxck up!\u201d like an Eddie Abbew rant. Porto 1-0 Arsenal. Read that again. Say it loudly so it settles in. Arsenal may have tried to Enter the Dragon like a Bruce Lee film but they just got showed that the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o has More Fire than that grime collective from East London. Basic house rules. Play with flames and you get burnt. What is an Arsenal full of guns when you come up against a last minute dagger?

Manchester United have a recent legacy of looking to elders to lead the line but enough of the washed kings, it\u2019s time for the humble prince.

Was balling out with goals in five consecutive league games but decided to hit them with \u201csix\u201d like a tag on a Drake record. The youngest player in Premier League history to complete the feat. They tried to say Rasmus went 007 twice but real ones know he was neither shaken nor stirred. Now he\u2019s popping out of place like he\u2019s double jointed. Started off by rounding the goalkeeper and doubled his tally by doing the Inzaghi finish.

Rasmus by name but Erasmus in movement the way he\u2019s schooling defenders home and away.

Wrapped up AFCON for the Elephants last Sunday. Trampled all over Sheffield United with a brace for the Seagulls yesterday. This is what you call taking your game to new heights. Make that four G+A in his last two games from club and country, but the stats only tell half the story. Started his career at the Right to Dream Academy in Ghana so you better WAKE THE F*CK UP to his talents. 11 goals and nine assists in 30 games on loan at Union Saint-Gilloise was enough for the Seagulls to make the bird call. Now he\u2019s reintroducing himself like Hov down in Hove. Heard RDZ was in need of an MVP against the Blades and Simon said \u201cI\u2019m a cut above the rest\u201d.

The Gunners just made history on a day the Red Devils will want to forget. Sold out the Emirates to set an all-time WSL record of 60,160 and delivered a performance the hottest ticket in town deserved.

This one was wrapped inside 40 like a vintage Drake beat. Geyse\u2019s O.G. got the party started before Lacasse said it\u2019s time to Take Care of business with the second.

Gambling sponsors and a prominent drinking culture exist in most footballing corners of the world \u2013 turning enjoyment of the game into a bit of an ethical labyrinth for practising Muslims to navigate. And during the holy month of Ramadan, the sport\u2019s hostility towards Islam has historically been even more prevalent. Yet in recent years, things have started to change, and for the better. Karim Benzema scoring a hat-trick in the Champions League just minutes after breaking his fast, Chelsea hosting Iftar at Stamford Bridge for local Muslims, Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 making Premier League history as the first players to break their fast during gameplay. Muslims around the world are beginning to feel like football is for them. VERSUS writer Ahmed Shooble explains why football\u2019s relationship with Ramadan is unique and why it means so much to him as a Muslim in this space.

The AS Roma bagsman returned to the pitch for the first time since his ACL injury in June last year. After 307 long days of recovery he\u2019s back just in time to push De Rossi\u2019s side into a Champions League place. The Italian word \u2018forza\u2019 can be translated as: \u201cthe ability to face the difficulties of life\u201d and Abraham\u2019s career sums this up best. This is a man who eats adversity for breakfast and washes it down with a tall glass of turbulence. From smashing up loan spells to leading the line for his boyhood Chelsea. This man has manifested greatness time and time again. The mentality of a striker is different. We\u2019re not talking about his leap when we say he\u2019s head and shoulders above the box people put him in. TA9 has completed his turnaround. Welcome back."}

La Manneh Masia has done it again. Everyone\u2019s talking about Foden and Palmer right now but best believe Rabbi\u2019s entered the chat thanks to his strike against Celtic. A 3-3 draw in injury time had Rabbi moving like Robben. The Old Firm might be one of football\u2019s most heated derbies but this baller remained the coolest person on the pitch. 3-2 down in the 93rd minute. Rabbi picked up the ball on the edge of the box before calling Iso like he\u2019s Caitlin Clark. Created the separation, shifted onto his right and hit the most perfect release possible. Wrapped the ball up and around Joe Hart like he wasn\u2019t even there. Whip, dip and chip. Brendan screamed \u201cRodger that!\u201d when his team went in front but he started barking \u201cMayday, Mayday!\u201d when Matondo dropped this combo. A goal that keeps Rangers dreaming of Disturbing The Peace like Guy Pearce. They may be one point behind their rivals, but with one game in hand and one more showdown, they know anything is possible. Especially with RM dropping timeless moments like this. The Admin is awake."}

Real ones know he put them on because his future\u2019s too bright. VVS clarity. Very Very Scary hours. They say heavy is the head that wears the crown, but all that silver won\u2019t weigh this baller down. With Madrid on the horizon, Endrick won\u2019t be the first good kid in a m.A.A.d city. But stepping into a new era of Gal\u00e1cticos is nothing for a player who\u2019s out of this world. This is a kid who takes heritage so seriously, he makes Pel\u00e9 look like his agemate.

The youngest in charge just showed his elders who\u2019s boss. Balling like an 18-year-old with 20 years of experience in this game. Scored a goal that\u2019ll live forever in a rivalry that never dies. Spun Liverpool\u2019s defence with one touch and shook their title dreams with a second. Unlocked a million core memories the way he was giving Macheda with that finish. Turned into Silent\u00f2 the way he said \u201cWatch Me Whip\u201d. Another OP strike with his first ever goal at OT. In a game of uncontrolled chaos, KM stayed cool, calm and collected. Pressure creates diamonds and this Rock shines bright in battle. Word to The Final Boss.

The quest for the three-count and the quest for three points are two polar opposite endeavours. But whether it\u2019s the Roman Reigns meme or WWE entrance themes on matchday playlists, football clubs across Europe are looking to professional wrestling as a cultural touchpoint. Football\u2019s appreciation of the \u2018heel\u2019 means fans love to hate Jose Mourinho and Neal Maupay in the same way wrestling fans hated Kurt Angle and Randy Orton. With the amount of climactic goals scored against former clubs, big teams get dumped out of cup competitions by underdogs and homegrown academy graduates turn into club legends, you\u2019d think football already has a writing room akin to wrestling.

When you talk about left-footed juggernauts, any conversation without this man\u2019s name is misguided. His goal catalogue might not be Big, but the quality of his entries is Narstie. Bro really made the net dance like a TikTok trend. When the crowd said \u201cSHOOOOOT!\u201d, best believe he wheeled into action. Call him Thomas the Traction Engine. Nicknamed Der Hammer but Thor ain\u2019t got nothing on his power. When the commentator shouted his name, it\u2019s only right that a screamer followed. In this modern era of cutback controllers and set-piece coaches, Hitzlsperger\u2019s range was extinct. And don\u2019t sleep on this baller\u2019s off pitch impact, either. Remains one of the highest-profile footballers to come out as gay after retiring in 2014, and has continued to campaign for LGBTQ+ individuals within football ever since. At a time when that community had no visibility in the game, he stood up tall and made them felt seen. This man is a standard-bearer on all fronts. Hitzlsperger Hive stand up."}

Call this shooter an agent of chaos the way he mastered the mayhem. No game plan? No tactics? No problem. The TL can\u2019t stop calling him Cold Palmer but this is a story of Ice and Fire.

Mac10 must\u2019ve heard the gun to kickstart the run-in and said \u201cit\u2019s time for me to load one up\u201d. Different League like Nines the way he\u2019s racked 10 G/A in his last 11 games. The Blades stepped out at Anfield looking like the Golden Arches so Alexis introduced them to the Big Mac. But don\u2019t confuse this teknician for delivering fast food football. He\u2019s serving up filet mignon magic right now. Might have started the season out of position but he\u2019s ending it at the front queue.

Then a classy assist to pick out Jeremy Sarmiento for his 97th minute winner. Put the word out, attacking full-backs are back in style. Someone tell Pep his four CBs gimmick is done. That\u2019s two goals and 16 assists in the league this season. You read that right. The most assists by a defender in Championship history. Premier League fans are licking their lips like Dinho. FPL content creators got a plan for him. England are crying out for a left-back with motion and Davis is moving mad."}

Nothing but thoughts and prayers to Frida Manuum after the Arsenal midfielder collapsed in stoppage time. Many have doubted their title credentials this season, but no one can question the strength in the face of adversity shown by the Gunners to get the job done. Overcame tough times on the pitch and showed why tough characters always last. Makes sense it was Frida\u2019s best mate Blackstenius that clinched the winner, because sometimes the script simply writes itself. The news that Frida is awake and stable means you won\u2019t hear a more satisfying headline all weekend. This is what real champion mentality looks like. Congratulations to the Gunners."}

Bagged an 83rd minute equaliser before saying \u201cI got one more in me\u201d like Vince Carter. If a thunderbastard in front of the Gallowgate doesn\u2019t move you, then maybe the numbers will. 100% dribbles completed. 100% shot accuracy. 100% playa.

Faced up against Cardiff and slayed the Welsh Dragon. Real ones know this is the league that Jude made his name in, but Jobe is showing that he knows the game too.

Used to have strikers screaming \u201cRrrrrr!\u201d as he cruised across the pitch. The type of baller that would have Pep salivating. The type of CB that would have at-home tacticos making TikToks about his game. The type of leader that would have Steven Bartlett twerking for a podcast interview. LK had Spurs dreaming like Martin. Still stands as the last captain to lift silverware for the club. Rocked a white kit and it always stayed glithening because he never had to slide. Real ones know Rolls Royces Roll Safe. Punters love a one club man but even Ledley turned the opps into fans. Ask Titi about this guy and his lip starts quivering. The only thing that could stop his supreme talent was his body and even then, he was still bossing it. Legends come and go but their influence will last forever.

The home jersey features a bright, white base \u2013 the first time the Super Eagles have worn a white home kit in three years \u2013 adorned by green and white sleeve cuffs, and matching shorts to mirror the Nigerian flag.

A large, red Nike Swoosh sits above the text, creating a colourway that pays homage to iconic Naija kits of the past.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe away kit is the real stunner in this duo, though. The black base creates the perfect backdrop for the bright green strokes of colour that cover the entire uniform. With a design that looks like water droplets on leaves, the kit is reminiscent of Nigeria\u2019s lowland forests \u2013 a fitting look as the kit drops just in time for the rainy season.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe Super Eagles\u2019 new kits will be available to purchase on the Nike website starting 21 March."}

In a time where systems and patterns are often over analysed, it\u2019s dope to see two ballers running a two-man game again. Trent and Robbo may have laid the Blueprint like Jay-Z for attacking fullbacks but it\u2019s beyond Reasonable Doubt that this pairing are the leaders of the new school.

Real ones know the 21-year-old\u2019s defensive fortitude is the reason why Everton are no longer in a sticky situation. The Toffees are only topped by Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal for least goals conceded. Built different at 6ft5 so it\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s got Premier League strikers calling him Big Dawg. The Cumbrian Cannavaro has been locking up forward lines and throwing away the key. From winning the Euros with the U21s last summer to being 21 and getting asked by Gareth if he can do something for him. This is a story of persevering and letting your talent do the talking.

The 23-year-old showed exactly why the Rossoneri placed their trust in him after coming off the bench in the 20th minute to replace Simon Kjaer, going straight into a heated Coppa Italia Milan derby just days after arriving in the country. Tomori made a vital sliding block against Romelu Lukaku, a goal line clearance, and looked assured on the ball in a game that saw Milan down to 10 men for a lot of it. During the match, Tomori made four clearances, won four ground duels, made three interceptions and completed 93% of his passes. Inter ran out winners thanks to a peachy Christian Eriksen free-kick in the 97th minute, and sees them advance to the semi-finals of the Italian cup. In Serie A, Milan currently sit top ahead of Inter, Roma and Juventus. Some introduction to Il Calcio."}

One call from Arteta, and another Gal\u00e1ctico was on the plane to London. Arsenal fans now busy picking off the umlaut and crossing a line through the \u2018O\u2019 on their shirts. There\u2019s a new playmaker in town. \u00d8degaard\u2019s been in the spotlight since signing for Madrid at just 15, and has had to graft to regain his status as one of the most exciting young ballers in the game. Still just 22, the Norse Nedved was different bisto at Real Sociedad last season. Going off those performances, he\u2019s got that wow factor required to make the difference in that tricky CAM slot. Alongside the Croydon De Bruyne & co., the future\u2019s beginning to look bright for Arsenal once again."}

Brought the FA Cup to Arsenal in his first season and it\u2019s barely left their side ever since. \u00d6ne of a kind baller. The game was never about himself \u2013\u00a0he played to bring the best out of others. 20/20 vision since day dot. Softest touch in the game. Always spoke up for what he believed in. Called out China for its treatment of Uighur Muslims while the rest of the world stayed silent. Even tried to get Gunnersaurus back in the club.

The last year has seen more of us suffer from mental health issues than ever before, and pro ballers are no different. The number of footballers seeking mental health support doubled last year, according to Fifpro, while the PFA reports 1/5 of current and former players admitted to feelings of depression. From academy teams through to the first team squad, the game needs to do far more to support the mental wellbeing of players who go through incredible pressure to perform at the highest level.

Makes pro football look like Powerleague. This don taught Bruno Fernandes how to stat pad. Numbers over everything. One of the greatest players to ever light up a pitch. 35-years-old and still a lot left in the tank. This guy never stops. You already know he\u2019s eyeing up 1000 goals before he\u2019s 40.

HE67 ain\u2019t the only young baller with a wand of left foot at the LFC Academy \u2013\u00a0cos this kid is next up out of La AXA. Slight in frame but ability is massive. Connor Bradley and Tyler Morton deserve their flowers but this debut is extra special. Came from Derby as one of the highest rated players in his age group. Tonight we saw why. Wayne Rooney labelled him \u201cfantastic\u201d so you better believe the kid\u2019s got unbelievable tekkers. Born two months after Wazza made his United debut but now he\u2019s balling out at the very top level for The Redmen. His debut also means cash-strapped Derby get \u00a3100,000 as a result. The KaideSZN and Gordonology accounts are being spawned as we write this cap. Jurgen Klopp has another serious jugador on his hands."}

{"prompt": "A substitute player scored a decisive goal and contributed to an own goal in an away match, earning man of the match honors despite limited playing time.", "completion": "Leon Bailey has landed. We need to talk about this baller\u2019s performance against Everton this weekend. Left the Toffees feeling sticky. The streets have been screaming \u2018World Boss\u2019 for a while but didn\u2019t know LB31 would be activated by it. Made sure the Villains\u2019 Cartel would secure all three points on the road and announced himself to the Premier League in style. Hopped off the bench and got it cracking in a cameo that can only be rivalled by Grant Mitchell in an Eastenders Christmas special. Forced an OG before thundering home his debut goal with serious vim. MOTM antics after just 21 Savage minutes on the pitch. Best grab your \u2018popcaan\u2019 every time this guy lines up in claret and blue. He is gonna Ova Dweet in the league this season."}
{"prompt": "Manchester United secured a comeback victory against West Ham United. A former West Ham player scored a decisive goal after coming on as a substitute, and the Manchester United goalkeeper saved a penalty.", "completion": "West Ham 1-2 Manchester United. This game was straight WWE scripting. Vince McMahon made the call and turned the Premier League into Survivor Series as Triple H\u2019s theme tune was blaring out of the London Stadium at KO. Whilst there was redemption for some, others had to take the fall. JL14 returned to East London to a standing ovation but made sure bubbles would burst. Came off the bench and scored a screamer that would have felt like a frog splash from top rope. DDG then turned hero at Noble's expense. A pen save United fans have been waiting for. Ending the streak like Brock did to Undertaker. The biannual remontada commences once again before heels turn once more. The Red Devils work their witchcraft once again putting the nails in the Hammers\u2019 coffin. Not a Super Sunday by the Super Team, but a W is a W."}

Five-star skiller, non-stop thriller. The Football Gods need to resurrect Joga Bonito ads for this baller alone. Another goal for ASM\u2019s highlight reel in tonight\u2019s 1-1 draw against Leeds. Danced through three defenders before hitting the finale. Commentary said ASM was doing his best Titi impression so he flicked the Va Va Voom switch. Saint-Maximin lost files about to hit different in 2030. Wore an LV headband on the pitch and now Virgil\u2019s about to rebrand it Off-Black-and-White. Different gravy. Haters said he didn\u2019t have end product. Real ones know that\u2019s now 2 goals and 2 assists in 5 games so far this season. Incroyable."}

Clean sheet? Check. Clutch assist? Check. 8-0 victory over North Macedonia in a World Cup qualifier? Check. Captain\u2019s performance from first minute to last. This top Gunner controlled midfield without breaking a sweat. Her through balls had people saying \u2018I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter\u2019. Silky smooth. The sort of performance that\u2019ll convince you to cop tickets for next summer\u2019s Euros ASAP. Don\u2019t sleep on what this Lionesses squad is doing right now. New manager, same vibes.

The clean emerald jersey looks fresh out of a Don Benzema drip video, with the shirt design paying homage to the iconic Kilometre Zero plaque in the heart of Madrid \u2013 which identifies the precise starting point of all the roads in Spain.\u00a0The jersey features the compass from the plaque, discretely woven into a graphic that features as an all-over repeat artwork printed down the front and back of the shirt.

Back in Europe, back in business. After five years away, the Irons pick up a W at the first time of asking. Heard they were playing Dinamo so gave them straight dynamite. Blew the opps away 0-2. Michail Antonio\u2019s rags to riches fairytale gets another chapter. Goalscorer on the European stage. Declan Rice took matters into his own hands and dropped a solo goal Payet would be proud of. European debut but you already know he belongs. You can\u2019t touch this kid. Hammer time."}

The game was ultimately decided by a significant goal late in the contest, with standout individual performances contributing to Liverpool's success.", "completion": "Liverpool 3-2 AC Milan. Sully would be asking \u201cyou still going on about that?\u201d the amount \u2018football heritage\u2019 gets used these days, but this was a true Champions League classic. Two European greats went blow for blow like they were back in Istanbul but Liverpool took the dub tonight. Plenty of history attached to this fixture but these two teams are looking like the truth right here and now. Only fitting for a classic match to be settled with a throwback banger. This was a total team performance from the Redmen to overcome a Rossonerri team who packed a serious punch. Fabinho dropped a monsterclass in the middle. Salah making comebacks bigger than setbacks after the penalty miss. Gomez live in the flesh like he never left. And JH14 pulled out his best Stevie G impression just for the occasion. Run that back, Hendo. UCL nights under the lights. We\u2019re back up."}
{"prompt": "A high-scoring Champions League match where Christopher Nkunku scored a hat-trick for RB Leipzig in a losing effort against Manchester City, who secured a dominant victory.", "completion": "Man City may have had the Etihad jumping tonight but we have to give some praise to Christopher Nkunku. Real \u2018No Help\u2019 hours. Put up a hat-trick and still ended up on the losing side as his team got hit for six. History maker yet defeat taster. First player to bag a hat-trick for RB Leipzig in the UCL and only the second to score one against City, but those three goals and a crate of Red Bull wouldn\u2019t produce enough energy to defeat Pep\u2019s men. Anything RB could do, City could do better. \u201cDouble up the opps score and send them packing\u201d was the team talk, and the \u00a3100m man understood the assignment. Always had dreams of balling out in the UCL and he showed he belongs. Put it on a plate for Nathan Ake at 1-0, sliced through the Leipzig defence and banged it top bins all by himself for 4-2. First Englishman to score and assist on a UCL debut since Wazza. Rockstar gene activated. Cancelo joined the action and shot from range like Bobby Lee Swagger in Shooter. Mahrez cooly converted from the spot yet still made Pep\u2019s head hot. Jesus came on late and rose up once again. City doing City things. The world is healing."}
{"prompt": "A player scored four goals in his Champions League debut match, securing a victory for his team.", "completion": "Sebastian Haller turned Sebastian Baller. Four goals on his Champions League debut to sink Sporting on night one. Y\u2019all must\u2019ve forgot. Three little birds, four big goals. Didn\u2019t set East London alight but this hitman has pedigree. Only the second player to score four times on his UCL debut after Marco van Basten. Dutch heritage in the air. Last season he was left out of Ajax\u2019s Europa squad by accident. Right now he's the unforgettable man."}
{"prompt": "A young player scored a goal for his team in a Champions League match, also contributing an assist, and the performance was highlighted by skillful ball control and a composed finishing touch.", "completion": "Jude Bellingham showing out on Champions League nights? We officially back up. 18-years-old and bagged Dortmund\u2019s first UCL goal of the season. You\u2019ll need to watch this one back a few times to truly appreciate the tek. Killed it with the chest, slept Besiktas with the first time finish. Hit the shush to stamp out any disrespect on his name. The Second City Saint steps up yet again. People laughed when Birmingham retired his shirt number, now they cry when he\u2019s slaying defenders like this on the big stage. One game, one goal, one assist. Press play on the Champions League anthem and let JB22 do the rest. The kid is elite."}

{"prompt": "The US Soccer Federation reached an agreement with the US Women's National Team regarding equal pay and working conditions, leading to identical contracts for both the men's and women's national teams. This move aims to equalize revenue sharing, particularly concerning World Cup prize money.", "completion": "A promising step towards pay equality has been made after the US Soccer Federation just announced that it's offering identical contracts to the the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams for the first time. The USWNT had previously filed a lawsuit in 2019 demanding equal pay \u2013 and while their claim was dismissed by a judge, an appeal was launched. Now, an agreement between the USSF and the women\u2019s team over working conditions has been reached. The move will align both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams revenues for the first time ever, with the proposal ensuring that USWNT and USMNT players remain among the highest paid senior national team players in the world collectively. The statement also said the federation was calling upon the players and both player associations to join it in \u201cfinding a way to equalise FIFA World Cup prize money between the USMNT and the USWNT\u201d.

The 19-year-old set a UCL record on night one, winning three penalties in the opening 35 minutes of RB Salzburg\u2019s 1-1 draw with Sevilla. The young hitman terrorised Sevilla\u2019s defence all game long with his direct running, fast footwork and speed - picking up the competition\u2019s first MOTM award of the season. If this baller isn\u2019t on your radar yet, fix up. He\u2019s bagged six goals in seven league games so far this season for RB, and scored on his international debut for Germany earlier this month. This kid is going right to the very top."}

It\u2019s a Blue Monday this evening with a New Order at the helm. Rafa Ben\u00edtez received a lot of hate from Everton fans before joining but there won\u2019t be a single Blue in Merseyside complaining now. Previous associations are forgiven. 4 games, 10 points. A new lease of life. There were a few Barclays heritage ballers on show but it was Andros Townsend who would rewind time. Scored his bi-annual screamer to silence his doubters. SOS in full effect. Shoot On Sight. His banger catalogue looking like Giggs' walk in the park album. Demarai made sure Burnley would feel Gray with a second soon after. 3 in 3 for the Brum Boniek. Man on a mission to show what he's about. Putting West Midlands back on the map like M1llionz. Shouts for bargain of the summer may not look so crazy anymore. Don\u2019t sleep on The Rafalution. The foundation has been set. These are just the facts."}
{"prompt": "Ian Wright broke Arsenal's all-time scoring record by netting his 197th goal.", "completion": "Uncle Ian. National Treasure. Cultural Hero. Iconic Figure. The reason why so many support Arsenal today. If Arsenal are \u2018Culture FC\u2019, then Wrighty is Director of Culture and Vibes. But today is an iconic day. In 1997, the kid from Woolwich became the all-time top scorer for Arsenal. It was meant to be. You can take the club out of the ends but you can\u2019t take the ends out of the club. Restoring the feeling for real. 197 goals to eclipse Cliff Bastin at Highbury. This Gunner proved he was the top marksman. Tapped in from close range and the stadium went ablaze. Just Do It became Just Done It. Ran around like Pac with history on his vest. Where do you think Kaka got the celebration from? \u201cIan Wright Wright Wright\u201d cheers as his doubters looked on and realised they had got it all wrong.\u00a0One of the realest careers seen in the Barclays. From semi-pro balling to league title collecting. His influence would lay the path for Thierry to do the same. Owned the pitch and now owns the Internet. Respect legends when you see them. HoF awaits."}
{"prompt": "Mohamed Salah scored his 100th Premier League goal, achieving this milestone faster than almost any other player in the league's history. He has maintained a high level of goal scoring consistently over five seasons, silencing critics who doubted his longevity and playing style. This achievement places him among the Premier League's elite forwards and positions him to break further scoring records.", "completion": "Mohamed Salah. 100 Premier League goals. The fifth fastest player ever to secure centurion status. Came back to the Premier League with unfinished business and told everyone they should've Known Better. Excellent finishes for five seasons straight. Critics labelled him a \u201cTap in merchant\u201d. Haters called him a \u201cstat padder\u201d. Pundits called him a \u201cone season wonder\u201d. F*ck them, he don\u2019t know them, they ain\u2019t 100. The Egyptian King just joined footballing royalty with the milestone. Mo's an elite bagsman alongside the likes of Shearer, Henry and Kane but he's been doing it on the wing. And he's just five off surpassing Didier Drogba. Dribbles. Headers. Volleys. Screamers. He's done the lot. And there's much more to come. Salute to one of the best Barclays forwards of all time."}
{"prompt": "A recent signing scored a goal on his debut shortly after coming on as a substitute.", "completion": "Eduardo Camavinga is living the dream. The Santiago Bernab\u00e9u welcomed him like a Gal\u00e1ctico and this young baller responded by finding the net. Deadline day signing, debut day goalscoring.\u00a0Madrid may have left it late in securing his services but EC25 has shown he was right on time. It only took the 18-year-old six minutes to bag after impressing early on. FM users around the world seeing their files come to reality. The starboy doing it on the big stage. Emirates say Fly Better but nothing makes you take off like this feeling. This is what dreams are made of. Modri\u0107 did the hard work and Camavinga ate. Generations are colliding. The lil bros are getting to eat with the big boys. The new era of ball is loading."}
{"prompt": "A player scored against his former club, celebrated by running the length of the pitch to taunt opposing fans, with a notable incident of a fan throwing an object.", "completion": "Emmanuel Adebayor. The man, the myth, the legend. 12 years ago today. The former Arsenal man turned Gunner against his old team and it was far from friendly fire. Baby Kanu bagged and ran the whole length of the pitch to taunt the Gooners. Camera panning like a drill video trying to keep up with him. Forget Certified Lover Boy. Certified Baby Boy was on all the smoke. One fan tried to chuck a table at him like Jeff Hardy in a TLC match. No Friends In The Industry. Elite shithousery. Layeth the Smacketh Down. I still can\u2019t believe he did this. Iconic."}
{"prompt": "Romelu Lukaku scored two goals in his first match back at Stamford Bridge, one with each foot, marking a significant return to the club after a decade.", "completion": "Romelu Lukaku. Either love him, or leave him alone. We said the Ruler's Back to Watch His Throne and that's exactly how RL9's moving this season. Celebrating like an archer, shooting like a sniper. Scored his first-ever goal at Stamford Bridge 10 years after making his debut. Good things come to those who wait. The first was so nice, he had to do it twice. Second goal came like a London bus. Left foot, right foot, devastating. A grade in his return to the bridge. He\u2019s already home."}
{"prompt": "A dominant team performance featuring multiple standout individual contributions, including a high-scoring return for a key player, an impressive assist tally from a midfield maestro, and a goal from another returning player.", "completion": "Manchester United are running on Scary Hours. The Red Devils turn back the clock to let the league know they're on demon time. The headlines will be on CR7's homecoming but don\u2019t sleep on the rest of this side. There's always talk on his name but Bruno remains inevitable. MG11 stays shining as one of the game's best young ballers. Shawberto keeps up the Joga Bonito form. Jesse Lingard is back balling out at the Theatre and grabbed his first goal for the club in over a year. And while this front line is set to give plenty of defenders sleepless nights this season, we need to hand a certain baller his flowers today. Paul Labile Pogba. Make that seven assists and counting in four games this season. Strapped on the shooting sleeve and is helping his teammates hoop. You best believe he\u2019s coming for Titi and KDB\u2019s assist record this season. It might be early for the super team shouts but the red half of Manny is jumping right now. How far can they go this season?"}
{"prompt": "A decisive debut performance where a player scored twice, including a very quick goal after being substituted on late in the match, leading to a team victory against a rival.", "completion": "Odsonne \u00c9douard has put the league on alert. Just scored two goals on his Premier League debut. The first player to do so since Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Haters said this league would be too much of a step up, but this Eagle saw its prey and got feeding. Subbed on in the 84th minute and bagged his first inside 27 seconds. Drake and Future might have been down the road but it\u2019s Nuno reporting live from the gutter tonight. Uncle Paddy picking up three points against Spurs like times of old. First win of Le Revolution was televised and it wasn\u2019t pretty viewing for one half of North London. Nuno calling quits after the third goal and penning up an apology letter quicker than we can whip up this cap. We told you not to sleep on this signing. Woy Division is finito but it looks like The Stone Roses are gonna be getting belted out at Selhurst this season. I Wanna Be Edouard. Something is happening here, believe in the Paddy V revolution."}
{"prompt": "Vivianne Miedema scored a hat-trick in a Champions League match against Slavia Prague, reaching her 100th goal for Arsenal in the process.", "completion": "Vivianne Miedema. 100 goals in 110 games for Arsenal. Centurion business. Bagged a hat-trick in tonight\u2019s Champions League game against Slavia Prague to hit three figures for AFC. Top Gunner. In 2019, she scored her 50th goal against Slavia. In 2021, she racks up Number 100 against the very same team. There\u2019s something in the water. Bottle it and get it on Dragon\u2019s Den ASAP. The 25-year-old took just 13 minutes to score all three goals tonight. A number unlucky for some but not for the GOAT. Gunning for victory is all she knows. The secret weapon in the club\u2019s Arsenal. Miedema is on another level. Aim for the moon and you\u2019ll find Miedema chilling amongst the stars. Give the Queen her own constellation. Orion\u2019s Belt? Make room for Miedema\u2019s Chain. You can\u2019t knock the hustle."}
{"prompt": "Alex Song's exceptional individual season in 2011/12, marked by his influential midfield play and prolific assist record, notably his partnership with Robin van Persie.", "completion": "Alex\u00a0Song. HBD to a genuine midfield maverick. If you know ball, you know about the partnership he built with RVP. In 2011/12, these two caused absolute destruction. Arsenal\u2019s answer to the Dudley Boyz. Turned the Emirates into Dudleyville and laid out defenders like they just took a 3-D through a table. People talk about HBA being the most creative baller in 2011/12 but numbers don\u2019t lie. 14 assists in all comps for AS17. Wenger lost Fabregas the previous summer but Le Professeur turned this one-time CB into a Creative Boss. Song by name but the opposition couldn\u2019t match his notes. Comp editors still eating Gucci off that Everton assist. Long lofted pass by Song, pinpoint first time volley by RVP. L1 + Triangle masher, baller of the highest stature. Assist so cold Rooney stole his flow and did the exact same thing one year later. $ongcoin was so high Barca broke the bank to secure his signature the next summer. Nothing was the same. If you\u2019re speaking facts, Song dropped one of the most underrated individual seasons in PL history that year. Streets Won\u2019t Forget Hall of Famer."}

Tonight was the battle of the No. 9s with captain\u2019s armbands and both showed they had something up their sleeves. HK9 drew first blood to turn a tense affair on its head with a long range belter. Set it and slap it season. Saw a former Arsenal player in goal and decided to turn gunner on him. Five goals in his last five international games and goals in 15 qualifiers in a row. Top striker settings but it wasn\u2019t enough to maintain Englands\u2019s 100% record in qualifying. RL9 understood the mission and this marksmen turned provider. A perfectly weighted cross converted. Word to Dave, Szyma\u0144ski managed to score for the Polish. The AEK Athens midfielder bagging his first international goal in Greek mythology fashion. Stoppage time equaliser to galvanise the fans in Warsaw and keep their World Cup dreams intact."}

New boy and Man City talent Cole Palmer secured the W by doubling England\u2019s lead with a goal that showed us all just how much talent he\u2019s got in his locker. The 19-year-old hit a Cruyff turn to send a defender spinning, before ending his tekky solo run with a clinical finish. His goal followed Rhian Brewster\u2019s opener, who won and converted an early penalty. Fellow City baller Taylor Harwood-Bellis also played alongside Arsenal\u2019s Tyreece John-Jules, Leicester\u2019s Luke Thomas and Manchester United\u2019s James Garner, currently on loan at Nottingham Forest.

Just bagged his first hat-trick for his nation. This lion is feasting. Heard they were disrespecting both the Bar\u00e7a and Dutch franchises and decided to put them on his back like his tat. Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil. Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside. We said MD10 means business in Bar\u00e7a, but he's taking flight for the Flying Dutchmen as well. The spirit of Cruyff is moving in him so much, he's joined the legend as 8th top scorer for the Netherlands. 28 goals and 14 assists in 2021. Numbers on numbers. Get you a striker that drops records and breaks them. Oranje going platinum again like Frank Ocean in 2012. This is what you call restoring all the feelings. The Young King is different with it."}

Free Jack movement vindicated. Harry Kane woke up and put Manuel Neuer to sleep. Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips went toe-to-toe with World Cup winners but showed they\u2019ve got pedigree.

He\u2019s got big shoes to fill, a point to prove and a philosophy to instil at Selhurst Park. His GOAT status in the game should see him attract some serious ballers to SE25.

Were heading out of the tournament as late as the 89th minute but winners don\u2019t quit. Matched the World Champs man for man over 120 mins and got their rewards. Seferovic with two headers that had OG turning green. Xhaka dyed his hair and went hard in the paint. Benz thought he had this game wrapped but got sent home in a Zuber. The heat turned up and Yann chose Sommertime. The A-Team in the last eight of a Euros for the first time ever. European Champs out one day, World Champs flying home the next.

Portugal threatened but there was no 2016 repeat. Brought on all their shooters but still firing blanks. Ronaldo still a GOAT but he won\u2019t be making it to the top of this mountain. The game needs to respect Roberto Martinez. Many have questioned his approach but you can\u2019t fault results. This Golden Gen got a lot left in the tank."}

We would say Czechmate, but that\u2019s old raps. This was a game of Chess not Czechkers. A cagey affair which the underdogs looked lively throughout. The win means they will now face the great Danes. Let's talk about this result though. Everything changed after De Ligt had to walk into De Light following a deliberate hand ball. The man in oranje saw red and nothing was the same. An old school set piece unlocked the door. Headed home by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hole\u0161 to give the Czechs the lead. A defender playing holding mid and wearing number 9? Fully here for it. Grabbed the assist for the second too. Layed it on a plate for Young Patrik to once again go Schicko Mode. Pure Pro Clubs shithousery. Four goals for this bagsman this campaign. Real Milan Baro\u0161 hours. Netherlands Schick to their stomachs and you have to feel for this talented team. But respect the Czechs though. Four quarter finals in their last seven European championships. That is real heritage. It wasn\u2019t quite Euro 2004 but the Czechs lit up the Dutch pack again.

Mancini\u2019s gladiators extend their unbeaten run to 31 games. They won\u2019t be leaving the Colosseum anytime soon. Let\u2019s talk about some special players, though. Federico Chiesa. Called game as soon as he stepped to the pitch. Austria had given Italy a real test but it was this baller who ensured it would be Gli Azzurri sending the \u201cGG\u201d message at FT. Controlled the ball on his head like an F2 baller before cutting in and letting fly. Real Bergkamp at France 98 vibes. They\u2019ll hate him cause he\u2019s like his pap\u00e0. That was just the start. Pessina wanted a slice and grabbed the second. Only made his debut a month ago and wasn\u2019t in the original squad for the Euros. When it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s your time. Sasa Kalajdzic did his best to bring the game back with a header but it wasn't enough. Massive shout out to Spinazzola. More like Spinnafullback.

The first Denmark player to score two goals in a Euros game since Nicklas Bendtner in 2012. Lords of the Strike. Still only 23-years-old, this hitman was regarded as one of Europe\u2019s best prospects since signed for Ajax as a 17-year-old \u2013 so KD12 came back to Amsterdam and showed them what they were missing. Let\u2019s shout out M\u00e6hle too. Game was already won but he still chose violence. Cut inside and sent Ben Davies for a slush puppy. This Danish side is officially a problem.

Including by the Admin it has to be said. But for 71 minutes last night, this team was going through from the Group of Death. Went ahead twice against Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s men but German efficiency was too much for Hungarian desire. Let\u2019s take this in properly though. Three games against three of the best teams in the world and some of the moments they provided in this tournament would have made Pusk\u00e1s proud. The brazy finish against France. The kick-off glitch header against Germany. 60,000 fans showing us what full stadiums were like for the first time in years. What could have been if they didn\u2019t concede three goals in 10 minutes against Portugal. And let\u2019s not forget they were missing their starboy\u00a0in Dominik Szoboszlai. They may not progress this time but Hungarian football is very much alive again.\u00a044 years was the gap between Hungary\u2019s 4th place finish at Euro \u201972 and their return to the competition in 2016.

England vs Germany. Born in Stuttgart and raised in Croydon, Musiala\u2019s international future was dominating the TL earlier this year.

The youngest\u00a0and now the oldest Croatian to score in the Euros as of last night. Been different gravy in the headband for decades. A lot of people say he\u2019s aged like a fine wine but he\u2019s been of a certain vintage his whole career. Someone tell him to change his @ to ChampagneLuka. This guy\u2019s track record from '08 \u2013\u00a0\u201921 been on Drizzy levels. All hits no misses. Haters who thought he was So Far Gone at 35. But Luka\u2019s got More Life running through his veins. Scored his latest in a manner that only he could pull off. Outside of the boot ping to leave David Marshall scrambling at thin air. World class finesse. But this performance had so much more than that strike. 115 touches 86 passes. 1 key pass. 100% successful dribbles. 1 assist. Absolutely certified display from one of the best in the business. People calling that Ballon D\u2019or fugazi ought to know better. Simply one of the greatest to ever kick ball."}

Let\u2019s take a moment to respect this young baller\u2019s performance tonight. First ever major tournament game and handled it like a seasoned vet. Lil Chilli turning up the heat on the main stage. Slow cooked Czech Republic with a game full of ability, bravery and composure. As easy as ABC. So gassed with his involvement he backed off his top like Balotelli. The Hale End Hagi adding more stock than an ASOS sale. The opps tried pulling Czechmate but Waistcoat dropped the Queen\u2019s Gambit. JG7 and BS25 from minute one. You love to see it. England through the last 16 without conceding a single goal. It\u2019s just getting started."}

This one was emotional. We all watched the first game. We all asked why they had been forced to resume that match so soon. We all feared they'd carry the effects of a traumatic event all tournament long. The Red and Whites just silenced any worries. This team haven\u2019t just played for Eriksen, they\u2019ve played for their whole nation and everyone around the world who showed them love. 4-1 winners against Russia. An elegant performance with outstanding goals from attack, wing backs and defence. They needed a helping hand from Belgium but the Great Danes showed there\u2019s a lot of fight left in this dog. The world of football celebrates a feel good story tonight. This is what togetherness, belief and purpose look like. What happens next? The sky\u2019s the limit. Danish Dynamite just blew this one wide open. Performance of the tournament so far. You love to see it."}

Holland just went 3 for 3 in the comfiest way imaginable. Kicked it and billed it in Amsterdam. Clive Tyldesley so mesmerised by the Dutch he thought replays were live chances. That\u2019s what high grade ball does to you. Group C was an absolute walk in the Vondelpark for De Oranje. Memphis Depay is on the hunt every time he puts on a Lions jersey. Gini Wijnaldum been off the chain in CAM. De Jong, De Ligt, Malen, Dumfries and Gravenberch all been baking off in this side too. They might have wondered what De Boer was smoking in Croydon that time, but he\u2019s got this Netherlands team on pure smoke at Euro 2020."}

As if this Italy team didn\u2019t look good enough already. Graced a Euro 2020 pitch for the first time and conducted this side like an orchestra. Biggest clinic Rome\u2019s seen since Maximus Decimus Meridius. This baller makes midfield play look like art. Always in space. Always has time. Always ice cold. First game back since injury and he ended with one assist and 94% pass accuracy. MV6 has been out in Paris collecting medals like Panini stickers for the longest, but he\u2019s got the whole of Europe in his sights this summer. Respect the levels."}

Delivered like Amazon Prime for Poland when they needed him most. Secured the point that keeps his country in the Euros. Put the pain in Spain. Make that 32 goals for club and country in 2021. The first ever Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships. CR7 is the only other hitman who can say he\u2019s done the same since 2012. Inevitable. Haters say this guy\u2019s never done it outside of Germany. Real ones know RL9 should be shining up a Ballon d\u2019Or by now. This baller and any other striker are poles apart. Elite."}

Despite lacking a primary striker, Germany demonstrated effective attacking play, with multiple players contributing goals.", "completion": "Germany just told everyone they can get the work. Secured a 4-2 dub against the Champs. Die Mannschaft are the team with the most European history, and they just showed Portugal that heritage trumps recency. They made this game look light work. Kein striker? Kein problem. Two OGs, two simple balls across the box. German efficiency at its best. When this team goes in, they go in. The King of Scratch and Sniff is smelling like roses tonight. Joachim L\u00f6w doing his best to go out on a high. Word to CR7 for that opener but even he couldn\u2019t carry his team over the line this time. It\u2019s Group F and the F\u2019s for Fu\u00dfball."}

Dropped an all-time great performance in Budapest to hold France to a 1-1 draw. The World Champions banging F in group F. Starved Mbapp\u00e9 and refused to serve Big Benz. Played in Houdini\u2019s backyard and pulled off a real magic trick. France got two stars on the jersey, but Hungary had 11 stars on the pitch. Atta Fiola writing his name in history. Clutch run and finish before kickstarting one of the most emotional celebrations you\u2019ll see all year. 61,000 fans letting limbs fly. WATTBA. Hungary feasting on the disrespect put on their name. No one gave this team a chance after game one but now the critics are eating their words. This Admin included. This team just dropped a clinic in minor setbacks, major comebacks. Group F is alive."}

The game may have been a stalemate but we saw some real flavour from the young Scot. 20-years-old and balled out on his first start for Scotland. Named Star of the Match for his fine showing. Hardly played this season, but Billy the Kid performed like Billy the goat. 44 passes attempted. 40 passes completed. Kept England not looking comfy in their own ends. Went head-to-head with his Cobham clubmate Mason Mount and showed he's undoubtedly got the minerals. The Ardrossan Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. May have been blowing like an old shape Corsa at one point but he flows like an Aston Martin. Locked up a game in CM that was meant to see England run riot. Respect big talent when you see it."}
{"prompt": "A dominant individual performance by Alexander Isak in a crucial qualifying match that propelled his team towards qualification for a major tournament.", "completion": "Alexander Isak. Star of the match. Scratch that. The star of Swedish football. Zlatan, thanks for your services but it\u2019s time for a new gen. The Stockholm starboy is going clear. VERSUS Euros ones to watch poster boy. We speak, you listen. Bringing big and tall strikers with feet back into fashion. 6ft4 but dribbling like prime Titi. Neat touches and mad finishes. The Nordic Nistelrooy. Got every fan on their knees for his signature this summer. Sweden may be nicknamed the Blue and Yellow but things are looked all glitter and gold right now. Top of the table and almost in the knockouts. Respect this certy baller and his compadres."}
{"prompt": "Denzel Dumfries scored two goals in the Netherlands' opening two matches of Euro 2020, establishing himself as a prominent player in the tournament.", "completion": "Denzel Dumfries is doing damage. Euro 2020 is less than one week old but this baller is already one of its biggest stories. Two goals in two games from WB for the Netherlands. The Rotterdam Roberto Carlos. If you don\u2019t know, now you know. Named after Denzel Washington and he\u2019s been dropping Hollywood performances all summer. Making every game look easy like Training Day. Man on Fire. This Memphis and DD link up? Remember the Titans. Early days for this tournament but you already know Premier League scouts are looking up his stats on Football Manager. 25-years-old but he\u2019s just getting started. This Flying Dutchman is sky high."}

This player orchestrated the team's comeback with a key assist and a decisive goal, ultimately confirming their progression to the knockout stages of the tournament.", "completion": "We need to talk about Kevin. As long as Belgium have De Bruyne on the pitch they\u2019re a threat at this tournament. Saw Belgium were losing at half time and said \u201cfine, I\u2019ll do it myself\u201d.\u00a0KDB was moving like Thanos the way he shaped time and space in this game. Slapped on the captain\u2019s armband like the infinity gauntlet and proceeded to dominate. Snapped his fingers and made two defenders cease to exist for his assist for Hazard for Belgium\u2019s first. Then cannoned in the second past Schmeichel in true Endgame style.\u00a0Dread it. Run from it. De Bruyne arrives all the same. KDB and the B is for Bruiser, but this team is stacked beyond the Ginger Pele. Name a better international trifecta than Romelu, Kevin and Eden\u2026 You\u2019ll find it hard. Restoring the feeling. Thierry Henry screaming va va voom as his team goes vim vim vim. This was favela balling with cobbled street finesse. The Red Devils are raging hell and a bunch of them are not fully fit. Knockout stage confirmed. Scary status? Also confirmed."}

Fikayo Tomori has joined AC Milan on a permanent deal following a successful loan spell with the Rossoneri.\u00a0The Business School Baresi passed all his modules with 1st class distinctions including a stand out performance in AC Milan\u2019s 3-0 win against Juventus in which he scored his first Serie A goal.\u00a0His importance to their young side has been clear to see, featuring 22 times in the league and Europa League campaign.

This baller just went from \u201cIYKYK\u201d to \u201cNext to Blow\u201d in 90 mins. Chose violence and dropped a clinic in the same night. Get a midfielder who can do both. 23-years-old and made the Swiss roll. Two goals tonight to send Italy into the last-16. Sassuolo valued him at \u00a340m before this game but they know the price of the brick just went up. Every tournament has a breakout baller and ML5 just put his name in the conversation.

Serious business, serious result. The game we\u2019ve been waiting for didn\u2019t disappoint. Les Bleus came to party and Pogba turned the Allianz into a\u00a0dancefloor. Kroos stuck in the mud like he\u2019s back in school. The German still wears adidas boots from 2014 but Pog showed him it was a new day. A masterclass in dominance and flamboyance. That Pioche pass was smoother than Takeoff\u2019s verse on \"Avalanche\" and gave Die Mannschaft a Straightenin. Rudiger realised Labile was moving Goated and wanted a taste. PP and Kant\u00e9 making everything look light work. This duo are undefeated in 28 international games together. Invincible like Wenger. France could have topped the night with goals from Kylian and Benz but VAR said no. The streets were robbed of two mega moments. Mbapp\u00e9 cha-cha sliding before sinking Neuer and Benzema\u2019s first goal back for France. We move, though.\u00a0Goku and Gohan will go again in their quest for the Dragon Balls, and this France team will keep disturbing the peace. Va Va Voom."}

But you should never write a player off with his kind of pedigree. Those who bought the dip are laughing with their profits right now. Ligue 1 champion with Les Dogues last season. Chasing greatness with Portugal once again this summer. I want you to put the word out there that we back up. This guy needs to be starting from here on out. Don't @ me with anything different."}

Saw Yarmolenko last night and chose to go Schicko mode. Flipped the Schwitch. Dominant header for the first, 50-yard lob over David Marshall for the main event. Had the keeper clapped in the net like Amanda in Saw 3. A real whipping excursion. Goal of the tournament? Lock it. Puskas award? Load it. The sort of performance to get big clubs twerking. The first Czech Republic player to score more than once in the same game at a Euros since Milan Baros in \u201904. Real heritage hours. Some people thought this team don\u2019t have shooters but real ones know Schick has nine G/A in his last nine starts. Czechmate. James St Patrik talking that Schick talk.

His display against Liverpool will never see him walk alone. Thrown into the deep end and became the lifeguard when his team was struggling. AK made six saves in total, but Spurs fans already knew they caught one after his first half display. Passing on point. Composure on ice. Fans are calling him 21 Savage after the dinked the ball over Jota. Fans thought they signed a promising shot-stopper. The truth is, they may have just signed a certified showstopper.

A real midfield dawg is off his leash and back outside. Bagged his first goal since tearing his ACL in November 2023 to send Barcelona to the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final. He might play in the spiritual home of tiki-taka, but Gavi\u2019s still got the passion for crashing it in every duel. Haters will say he thinks he\u2019s Gattuso. Real ones know this is a Gennarotional talent. Putting his head where most ballers would be scared to put their foot. Meaty challenges like he\u2019s Terry Butcher. But still knows how to carve open a defence. Streets had to wait years to see Pedri and Gavi cook in midfield. And they flamed Athletic Club on high heat. A brotherly braising. The one they called Scrappy Doo is barking off his ting again. Let him cook."}

Ola remains unapologetically himself. At a time when many players aren\u2019t showing their true selves due to media condemnation, it\u2019s refreshing to see someone break the mould and the internet in the process.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe snaps are cool but we need more. Get him a TV crew and let\u2019s get this show on the air."}

Enjoying one of her finest starts to a season for Chelsea. Now she\u2019s penned a one-year extension on her contract so she can keep writing her name in lights. Top scorer in a team that\u2019s yet to taste defeat so far, but you know Guro stays feeding families. This is what it looks like sow the seeds of greatness and reap your rewards. When you mention the name Reiten, know that you\u2019re talking about a winger you can\u2019t cross. It takes a magical baller to stand out in one of the most dominant sides in the country, and GR11 stays pulling rabbits out the hat. Already notched five WSL titles, three FA Cups, two League Cups and the Community Shield in nearly five years in west London. But Reiten\u2019s reign ain\u2019t done just yet."}

The win featured a strong defensive performance from Fikayo Tomori and the decisive winning goal scored by Tammy Abraham.", "completion": "Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori. From Cobham to Championships. AC Milan\u2019s victory in the Super Cup last night marked yet another moment for the Italian club\u2019s Chelsea academy contingent. A defence marshalled by Fikayo and a winning goal scored by Tammy. From 2-0 down to 3-2 winners against their bitter rivals in Inter. It\u2019s safe to say this victory will go down in the history books. But it\u2019s easy to forget these two ballers have often been competitors. From their days of proving themselves in the Championship to going to war against each other in Serie A. Now they\u2019re reunited for the Rossoneri and winning together just like they did in the youth ranks. Sometimes you have to leave home to build your own house. But one thing is for sure, these brothers are showing that the house wins together."}
{"prompt": "A prominent football player's arrival at a training session, featuring a custom-designed jacket that paid tribute to the club's historic past.", "completion": "Leah Williamson turned up to training after the winter break in the coldest custom piece. Rocking up to London Colney, the Arsenal defender wore a one-of-one leather jacket created by London-based designer, Antonia Bronze. The reworked biker jacket paid homage to the Gunners\u2019 2004/05 season courtesy of its classic red and white two-tone base, centralised Arsenal badge and famous O2 sponsor. Williamson\u2019s No.6 and \u2018Gooner\u2019 are stitched onto the back of the jacket in that iconic Premier League font synonymous with the early 00s, \u2018LW6\u2019 and canon details also feature. Bronze made headlines last summer during the Euros thanks to Tolami Benson\u2019s viral Bukayo Saka jacket. Since then, both Gabrielle Figueiredo and Yasmin Bergkamp have commissioned the designer, with each respective piece championing their husband and father \u2013 Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and Dennis Bergkamp. Williamson might be the first women\u2019s player to cop a Bronze jacket but she certainly won\u2019t be the last."}

Made her first start of the season for Bar\u00e7a and balled out like she never left. Notched 2G + 1A against Sociedad to show the streets the Real is back. Crashed in her first goal from range and ended a slick passing move with her second. Silk and steel in one peak performance. Barcelona might have the best players in the world right now, but Salma just reminded everyone she\u2019s the future of the franchise. And she ain\u2019t afraid to put the world on notice early doors, either. Used to run track before she started kicking ball, now her opps can\u2019t track her runs. Give it a couple more years and the baton will be hers. One of the best young ballers in world football is back outside."}

You can take the baller away from his home, but you can\u2019t take the hustle out of the baller. Bagged a goal in Napoli\u2019s 3-0 win at Fiorentina over the weekend to cap a POTM performance. But this is bigger than one game. McTominay is having the season of his life. Touched down in Italy in the summer and is already holding his own in a title race. This right here is a lesson in backing yourself to front up the best performances of your career. They say the grass ain\u2019t always greener on the other side, but SM8 is cooking with pesto. Had to settle for a bench role when he was at United, but Conte\u2019s given him the keys in Naples. And they are about to unlock the door to the Promised Land. Forget running around like Pac, McTom\u2019s running around the pitch like Braveheart and yelling \u2018FREEDOM!\u2019 with every touch. Might not be balling out at OT anymore, but La Carrington stays producing quality. Forget what you heard. McSauce is mustard."}

These two giants just whipped up an old school classic. The streets were expecting another Anfield annihilation but Ruben sent the Slot Machine spinning. Yanited haven\u2019t won at Anfield since 2016 but this time they\u2019re finally leaving with something. Straight box-to-box office. Trent woke up thinking about Madrid and The Butcher responded by carving up a nightmare. Gakpo saw the snow and moved Tricky like SSX for the equaliser. Mo picked up the pen and thought he finished the story until Amad picked up the pad. Make that a winner against City and an equaliser against LFC with his last two PL goals. You haven\u2019t seen anyone do this much damage in a turf war since CJ in San Andreas. 2025 is only just starting but this one just rolled the clock back and reminded us what we\u2019ve been missing. The real is back."}

Take a bow. This is what a stoppage time stepper looks like. Came off the bench for Norwich in the 84th minute. Bagged the equaliser in the 91st. Sunk the winner in the 95th. 12 minutes of match-winning mayhem from this Ghanaian gunman. Real centre of attention antics. Main character manoeuvres. May not have had the best first half of the season, but this is how you make up for lost time. Bopped onto the pitch and walked all over Coventry\u2019s chances of leaving with something. Frank\u2019s Lampardian switch in the post-match press conference is about to be cash money. Joined the Canaries from RB Salzburg in the summer so you know he\u2019s got the wings to fly sky high. Might play as a CM, but this 22 year old keeps a deuce deuce tucked. You\u2019d be wise to watch out."}

This baller is proof that no obstacle is greater than the goal. Joined Brentford from Sampdoria in the summer of 2022. Missed the last six months of his time in Italy after a knee operation revealed he suffers from arthritis. The Bees worked with him through his condition and now their faith is being repaid in poetic performances. Bagged another majestic assist in Brentford\u2019s 5-0 drubbing of Southampton to take his tally up to seven. Only Salah and Saka have more this season. Haters will talk about his hairline. Real ones know he came from the fringes to being undroppable. From underused to underdog. Put some respect on this great Dane\u2019s name."}
{"prompt": "A decisive 1-0 away victory for AFC Bournemouth against Everton, secured by a game-winning assist from Milos Kerkez.", "completion": "Milos Kerkez is stepping up and showing out. In an era of 6ft+ back lines, this is how you restore the feeling of attacking full-backs. Cutting through the last line like prime Roberto Carlos and starting trouble in the final third. Enjoying his best season for the Cherries but this game was the pick of the bunch. Bagged the game-winning assist in Bournemouth\u2019s 1-0 win over the Toffees. It ain\u2019t easy to put one past Dyche\u2019s army in their own back garden, but Milos had Everton moving shaky in their own ends. Most players would\u2019ve just hooked the ball in his position, but MK won the game with a Fatality. Call him Sub-Zero the way he\u2019s too cold with it. If your club\u2019s in the market, Kerkez is a LB you can\u2019t afford to Leave Behind."}

You\u2019re looking at the type of jugador who gets respect on these streets. If you didn\u2019t know about this baller before today, it\u2019s time to start taking notes. Spurs didn\u2019t come away with the dub but this prince got to shining against Newcastle. Only 18-years-old and stood tall against the toughest midfielders in the league. They rolled with punches, he rolled with panache. Brave on the ball. Deadly in his duels. Whole squad out wounded and this guy went into the battle like Rambo. Left the stadium to a standing ovation so you know he even had Expressions Oozing. Spurs slander might be top of the TL\u2019s agenda but don\u2019t let Bergvall\u2019s come up go under the radar. The story starts now."}
{"prompt": "Jacob Murphy's decisive assist in Newcastle's 2-1 away victory against Tottenham, underscoring his impressive run of form and significant contribution to the team's current six-game winning streak.", "completion": "Jacob Murphy needs his flowers. We are witnessing one of the most unsung players in the league hit all the high notes. Bagged another assist in Newcastle\u2019s 2-1 win at Spurs. Make that 3G + 5A in the team\u2019s six-game win streak and we are looking at one of the most in-form players in the Prem. This is how you turn yourself from journeyman into main man. Was sent out on loan twice since joining the Magpies but now he\u2019s feeling right at home. When the Saudi money came in, haters thought Murphy would be the first to leave. Now he\u2019s entering a peak nobody saw coming. From undesirable to undeniable. Isak\u2019s eating good because JM23 stays whipping up something devious in the kitchen. Order up."}

Never count this baller out. Grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat against Valencia when it looked like the sharks were circling. Knew the haters were cooking up agendas mid-game and served up the biggest slice of \u2018hold dat\u2019 pie. Might\u2019ve missed his pen to level the game, but the writing was always on the wall. One of the most inevitable players in world football did his signature with a ballpoint. Assisted Luka Modri\u0107\u2019s equaliser in the 85th minute. Then bagged the 96th-minute winner to make critics turn their TVs off like K Dot. With a middle name like Victor, what did you expect? Going down to 10 doesn\u2019t matter when you can drop a 10 on your ones. Played in Madrid\u2019s orange kit, but Jude was the only one playing with vitamin Clutch. Let this be a lesson. It doesn\u2019t matter how you start. It\u2019s the redemption that creates legends. And JB5 is Just Beginning his reign. Take cover."}

The flying dutchman turned airborne clutchman with his MOTM performance in the Super Cup. Banged a brace that would have felt like a punch to the face for the opposition. Acrobatic finish for his first and an astonishing outside-the-box strike for his second. Whilst some people\u2019s New Year resolution is to be their best selves, this baller\u2019s was to be a savage. The way Dumfries was moving, we could\u2019ve been watching Maicon back in \u201809. Real blast from the past hours. Everlasting pace, excessive power and emphatic finishing. Had fans screaming \u201ceeeee!\u201d has he evaded enemy resistance. We ain\u2019t talking about Mr Washington when we say Denzel is a Man On Fire. This is how you set the new year ablaze."}

Hale End\u2019s got The Admin shouting \u201cthey\u2019ve done it again!\u201d like Lee Judges. Made his first Premier League start for Arsenal and played like a seasoned pro. Stepped up in Little Chilli\u2019s absence and gave Brentford pepper. Pulled up at the same ground where he became the youngest player the league has ever seen and showed the streets what a young G with tek really looks like. They say \u201cact like you\u2019ve been here before\u201d and Ethan\u2019s gone from a rotational option to hooping with the seniors overnight. Call that full circle. Arsenal fans had nightmares when Saka went down injured. But now Nwaneri\u2019s on a mission to make sure no-one sleeps on his rise. Going from Bukayo to Ethan at RW is the kind of greed they talk about in the Bible. This is how you win POTM on pure motion. Dribbling, IQ, je ne sais quoi. This kid\u2019s got it all. Still young enough to be in sixth form. But cold enough where his Final Form could be unstoppable. Super Saiyan status pending. Put the word out. Nwaneri\u2019s scary."}
{"prompt": "A dominant individual performance by Liam Delap for Ipswich against Chelsea, where he scored the opening goal and assisted another, significantly contributing to his team's major victory.", "completion": "Liam Delap chiefed up Chelsea. Dropped an old school No.9 performance Ricardo Fuller would be proud of. The son of an iconic Barclaysman so you know he\u2019s about banking cash money performances. Opened the scoring against the Blues 15 years after his dad did the same for Stoke. Rory Delap might\u2019ve been known for his long throws but LD\u2019s dashing Live Corn at all oncomers. This is what leading the line looks like. On the night the Tractor Boys got their biggest dub of the season, it\u2019s only right that their best player ploughed through his opps. Agricultural drillings. One-man up on the counter but carrying the motion of an army. Every time Liam had the ball, best believe Chelsea defenders were in Delap of the gods. Real grown man hoops from a YG. Only 21 but just still moving so Savage. Had the commentator saying \u201cIssa knife through butter\u201d the way he cut through Chelsea\u2019s back line. Teed up Hutchinson to clinch the second goal and grab the headlines. An all-round menacing performance. Not talking Kendrick when we say it was crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious. Ipswich\u2019s star striker continues to up his switch and let it ring among the big boys. Take cover."}
{"prompt": "Morgan Gibbs-White scored a skillful goal for Nottingham Forest against Everton, featuring a deceptive move past a defender and a precise finish.", "completion": "Morgan Gibbs-White stuck it on the Toffees. A lot of names get brought up to celebrate Forest\u2019s rise from famine to feast, but MGW needs his flowers. Bagged a peach of a goal that sent Everton\u2019s defenders to the pits. Make that 2G + 3A in his last five games and it\u2019s clear this is one of the best creative midfielders the Prem has to offer. Stylin\u2019 and profilin\u2019. Saucing and enforcing. Putting his stamp on the game like he works for Royal Mail. Delivering on a Sunday? How diligent. Why shoot first-time when you can send your marker to the shops and find a top shelf finish with your weaker foot? Make no mistake. This is a baller who\u2019s morphing into his final form. Pulling up trees for Forest and rooting out any doubters throwing shade on his name. This is the kind of talent they build franchises around. And a couple big teams will be throwing the bag sooner rather than later. Put the word out. Gibbs-White is going to the top."}

Haters tried to say he was cooked, but this is how you simmer things down to a boil. With great tek comes great responsibility and Eze is saving the day once again. Crashed in a sweet winner against Southampton to remind the streets what quality looks like. This is how a talisman leads by example. Palace might have had a rough start to the season, but Eze is the smoothest operator about. Let\u2019s not front, this is a jugador you can\u2019t afford to turn your back on. No matter how bad things are going, you can count on this Eagle to let fly and find bins. Casuals tried to say Palace needed to troubleshoot after losing Olise. Real ones know EE has no problem connecting with the net. This is why you can\u2019t write off the best ballers. They know how to pen a happy ending. Eze\u2019s redemption arc has just begun."}

Sometimes when a team is down on their luck, they need a player to rise it and drag everyone else out the mud. And Savinho just cleaned up. Bagged his first goal and assist in the league to secure City\u2019s 2-0 dub over Leicester. Been passing the eye test like he\u2019s got 20/20 vision. Haters will laugh that it took him this long. Real ones know it\u2019s never too late to flip the script. Celebrated with a ball under his shirt because becoming a top baller takes baby steps. The streets have been trying to remove \u2018inho\u2019 from his name. But this whole time \u2018Sav\u2019 was short for saviour. Saw how Haaland was starving in front of goal and served one on a plate to break his fast. We\u2019re witnessing the making of a matchwinner. Don\u2019t sleep."}

Took him a while to find his best role at Liverpool, but now he\u2019s moving like the protagonist. Klopp had him doing up No.8, but now Gakpo\u2019s eating on the left. Ever since Arne\u2019s Slot him onto the wing, he\u2019s been making his opps look like BBQ chicken. G+A vs Leicester to remind Ruud nice ballers finish first. Crashed in a screamer just before the break and teed up Salah to silence the haters for barking up the wrong tree. Had a reawakening and reemerged as Robben. Gakpo really bounced back and became Bale. Downloading that Finesse Shot+ expansion pack one banger at a time. They tried to shoehorn him into ST, but Cody is showing everyone that he can Start Trouble from out wide. 10 goals now for the season to go with a performance to convince the doubters there\u2019s 10 more to come. Rescued the dub for the league leaders. Call that Dutch deliverance. When competition for places is tight, you gotta be cash money. The way he rose it against Leicester, Gakpo just proved he knows how to get to the bread."}

Bagged the only goal of the game as Middlesbrough beat Chelsea 1-0 in the Carabao Cup. Might share his name with an East London borough but all roads are leading to Wembley right now. HH coming like Helly Hansen the way he zipped up the Blues backline tonight. The first Boro baller to score against Chels since Mark Viduka in 2006. Hit the winner to take the headlines but don\u2019t sleep on his performance across the Total 90. Completed seven dribbles, made one key pass and won possession six times. Might have flown under the radar so far but at 21-years-old his story is just getting started. The bright lights are ready."}

Call him A-boomerang the way it\u2019s coming back full circle. Spent a decade away from France but now he's returned to the Uber Eats for another bite. 34-years-old but playing like the 24-year-old version of himself. Make that 20 goal contributions for Marseille this season. 13 goals and 7 assists. His latest strike was one for the scrapbook. Initials may be PEA but the chip he delivered was sweet corn for the opposition. A darting run topped with the most delicate of touches to alert the world that he\u2019s still got it.
